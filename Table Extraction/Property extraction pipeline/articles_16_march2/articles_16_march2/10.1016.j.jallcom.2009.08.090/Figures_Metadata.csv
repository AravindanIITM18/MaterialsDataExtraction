fig9,articles_all/10.1016.j.jallcom.2009.08.090/figures/gr9.jpg,Fig. 9,"(a). Plots of hardness for H-xand D-xwith error bar. (b) Plots of hardness for H-xand D-xand volume fraction of BCC as a function of the molar ratio of Al,x. Note that the three curves seem to obey the same x dependence in (b). (c) Plots of the hardness and hardening ratio as a function of the volume function of FCC. Note that both curves have monotonically decreasing linear relationship with volume fraction of FCC in (c)."
