0,Abstract,"To have a further investigation of their physical properties such as electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties, the microstructure and mechanical property of Al                        x                     CoCrFeNi alloys have to have a detailed and systematic study. We present the effects of Al content on microstructure and mechanical property of as-cast, -homogenized, and -deformed Al                        x                     CoCrFeNi alloys in this study. It shows that single FCC and single BCC solutions, and duplex FCC–BCC are principal phases in these alloys. The x intervals for duplex FCC–BCC of different states of these alloys are investigated. The spinodal decomposition of less Al–Ni and more Al–Ni phases is the major reaction during homogenization of the alloys. The morphology of the less and more Al–Ni phases is also discussed. There is no stress-induced phase transformation during 50%-rolling deformation, and the main strengthening mechanism is work hardening. The hardening ability of FCC was about twice that of BCC in this alloy system.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The conventional strategy for developing alloys has selected one or two principal components for primary properties and other minor components for acquisition of definite microstructure and properties, such as steels, Ti–Al intermetallics[1], bulk metallic glasses[2–4], etc. Traditional metallurgical theory suggests that multiple alloying elements in an alloy lead to the formation of many compounds with complex microstructure and poor mechanical properties[5]. However, recently this paradigm has been broken by new alloy system, high-entropy alloys (HEAs). The HEAs were suggested by Professor Jien-Wei Yeh and demonstrated by Professor Swe-Kai Chen, respectively, at the National Tsing Hua University in 1995[6]. HEA greatly differs from conventional alloys because multiple major components are used in the former rather than only one or two component(s) in the latter. Moreover, HEA is defined as an alloy containingnmajor elements, wherenis between 5 and 13, and the molar ratio of each element is from 5 to 35at%. The selection of HEA certainly causes new findings, so HEA is expected to develop more alloys that have special properties.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"HEA has been studied extensively in recent years, and has more excellent properties than conventional alloys: high ability of forming nano-scale precipitation[7], good thermal stability[8], superior extensive or compressive[9]properties, extremely high hardness[8], excellent anticorrosive properties[10], special electrical and magnetic properties[11], and simple microstructures with solid solution of multiple elements[12–14]. Great applications[15–23], such as molds and structural materials at high temperature, wearing and abrasion-resistant coating, and even military engineering, have generally been expected in terms of the above unique characteristics. Consequently, not only large applied advantages but also great investigation potential indeed exists in HEAs.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Kinds of alloys like AlxCoCrFeNi have been the most thoroughly studied high-entropy alloys until now. However, properties such as electrical, magnetic, and thermal of these alloys are of research interest. Therefore, in this study, effects of various Al contents in AlxCoCrFeNi (x=0–2) on the hardness and microstructure will be discussed from their as-cast, -homogenized, and -deformed states by XRD, SEM/EDS, and Vickers hardness tester. The relation of hardness to microstructure is also quantitatively discussed. It is aimed to provide a reference study for further physical investigations discussed elsewhere. Therefore, basic data such as the lattice constants of different processing conditions are also listed in this study.",[],[]
2,Experimental details,"Al, Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni with purity greater than 99.5% are used. A total of 40–50g material was used to prepared AlxCoCrFeNi (0≤x≤2) alloys by vacuum arc-remelter. After the alloys were re-melted, they were turned over for process repeating at least three times to insure that the alloys were well mixed. As-cast alloys were heated to 1100°C at a rate of 20°C/min and stayed at 1100°C for 24h. The samples were then water quenched. These heated and quenched samples are called as-homogenized ones. The homogenized samples were cold deformed by the DBR250 two-high rolling mill to a 50% reduction of thickness. Cracks appeared for samples with the molar ratio of Al over 0.875 (i.e.,x>0.875) owing to the high hardness of the samples. Therefore the as-deformed samples are only for 0≤x≤0.875 in this study. Hereafter C-x, H-x, and D-xrepresent as-cast, -homogenized, and -deformed AlxCoCrFeNi (0≤x≤2) alloys, respectively. Before microstructural observation, the as-cast, -homogenized, and -deformed samples were cut with diamond cutter, and ground by #240, #400, #800, #1200, #2000, #2400, and #4000 SiC sandpapers in sequence. The samples were then wet-polished with 1, 0.3, and 0.05μm Al2O3powders. A JEOL JSM840A SEM was used to observe the microstructure of the samples, and composition was analyzed with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). An X-ray diffractometer RIGAKU ME510-FM2 was employed to test the crystal structure of the samples. The Cu target whose characteristic wavelengthλ(Kα1)=1.54056Å was used, and the working voltage and current were 30kV and 20mA, respectively. The scanning range 2θwas from 20° to 100°, and the scanning rate was 4°/min. The lattice constants were obtained by the standard procedure introduced in usual textbook[24]. The hardness was measured with a hardness tester, MATSUZAWA SEIKI MV-1. The samples were imposed load of 5kg, load time of 15s, and load rate of 50μm/s. Each sample was measured at seven distinct regions and the average of the values was taken as the hardness value.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.As-cast AlxCoCrFeNi (C-x),"According to the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1 and SEM images shown in Fig. 2 , the microstructure for C-0, C-0.25, and C-0.375 is single face-centered cubic (FCC) phase. The microstructure for C-0.50 and C-0.75 is body-centered cubic (BCC) and FCC duplex phase ( Figs. 1  and 2(c)–(e)). The microstructure for C-0.875 to C-2.00 becomes single BCC phase as shown in Figs. 1  and 2(f)–(j). Interestingly, grain structures are observed in Fig. 2(h) –(j). The compositional analyses by EDS on different phases obtained from Fig. 2 are listed in Table 1 . Lattice constants for C-xalloys are listed in Table 2 . From the above discussion, one can draw a conclusion that Al is a BCC former. This conclusion conforms to the same results of Refs.[8,25]. As the amount of Al increases (x≥1), one can also observe the ordered BCC peaks ( Fig. 1 ). Note that, in Fig. 1 , the 3rd peak of FCC (220), in C-0.375 and the 2nd peak of BCC (200), in C-0.875 are missing.","['fig1', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig2', 'fig1', 'fig2']","['tbl1', 'tbl2']"
3.1,Results and discussion.As-cast AlxCoCrFeNi (C-x),"The hardness for C-xalloys is listed in Table 2 and illustrated in Fig. 3 . Note that both C-0.375 and C-0.875 alloys have the highest hardness for single FCC or single BCC phase in C-xalloys, respectively. This can be attributed to the supersaturated solution hardening and the texture mentioned in the last paragraph. The phases of C-0.375 and C-0.875 are not thermodynamically stable because they were fast cooled during casting. Hence, the atoms did not have enough time to accommodate themselves or to combine to form a new phase. This result was moreover confirmed after homogenization (mentioned in the next section).",['fig3'],['tbl2']
3.1,Results and discussion.As-cast AlxCoCrFeNi (C-x),"According to Fig. 3 , the phase can be divided into three regions. That is (1) FCC for 0≤x≤0.375, (2) FCC–BCC for 0.50≤x≤0.75, and (3) BCC for 0.875≤x≤2.00 for C-xalloys. Two vertical lines are aligned to the average hardness lines of FCC and BCC and intersected the inclined line of the FCC–BCC transition region as shown in Fig. 3 . The intersecting points thus made correspond to the boundaries of the transition region and they are approximatelyx=0.45 and 0.875. However, the boundaries are relatively unstable (see below for further discussion). The volume fractions of FCC and BCC phase in the transition region can be calculated as follows. The average hardness values of single FCC and single BCC are designated to beHFCCandHBCC, respectively. Accordingly, the hardnessHin the transition region can be expressed as follows:(1)H=aHFCC+(1−a)HBCC,a=(HBCC−H)(HBCC−HFCC),whereais the volume fraction of FCC, and (1−a) is that of BCC. By doing this, one can obtain thexinterval for transition region of C-xto be as 0.45≤x≤0.88, rather than to be as 0.50≤x≤0.75. Hence, the volume fraction for C-xcan be shown in Table 1 . The later sections also use this method to determine the detailed transition boundaries and the volume fractions of FCC and BCC in various conditions. This calculation is helpful for discussion, especially in resistivity and magnetic properties that depend sensitively on microstructure.","['fig3', 'fig3']",['tbl1']
3.2,Results and discussion.As-homogenized AlxCoCrFeNi (H-x),"There is phase change for as-cast AlxCoCrFeNi after homogenization 24h at 1100°C. XRD patterns, SEM images, and hardness-xplot for H-xare shown in Figs. 4 –6, respectively. The black spots shown at the right side of Fig. 5(g)  are retained holes formed during casting. Composition from EDS, and lattice constants and hardness for H-xare listed inTables 3 and 4, respectively. One can easily see that Al–Ni-rich BCC phase appears for alloys ofx≥0.375. Although XRD patterns show single BCC phase forx≥1.25, there are still Al–Ni-rich phases forx≥0.375 in structure as can be seen in Fig. 5(c) –(g) and Table 3 . It suggests, in this study, that the Al–Ni-rich phase appears as a result of relatively large mixing enthalpy between Al and Ni. That is, for 0.375≤x≤1.00 there is Al–Ni-rich phase, which is an ordered BCC phase. For 1.25≤x≤2.00, in addition to the formation of ordered BCC Al–Ni-rich matrix phase, there is an Al–Ni-less BCC phase. After homogenization, the Al–Ni-rich phase coarsens as can be seen in Fig. 5(d) –(e) for H-0.50 and H-0.75. The Al–Ni-rich phase can have various kinds of morphology from needle- (for H-0.375 and H-0.50) to droplet-shaped (for H-0.75). The Al–Ni-rich phase becomes matrix phase for H-0.875 to H-2.00, and the Al–Ni-less phase is wall-shaped. One can see that the FCC phase is also wall-shaped for H-0.875 and H-1.00 ( Fig. 5 ). The wall-shaped microstructure from H-0.875 to H-2.00 might be from spinodal decomposition similar to the appearance of Al–Ni-rich phase in Alnico alloys[26]. Therefore, Al–Ni-rich phase in this study is probably from spinodal decomposition rather than the process of nucleation and growth. The Al–Ni-rich phase actually has an ordered CsCl structure corresponding to the peak of ordered BCC in Fig. 4 . Comparing with Fig. 3 , the hardness of H-xlisted in Table 4 and shown in Fig. 6 (referred to the dashed schematic line) also agreed that the hardness increases due to increase in volume fraction of BCC phase for H-0.375 and H-0.50. On the contrary, the hardness decreases due to decrease in volume fraction of BCC phase for H-0.75, H-0.875, and H-1.00. The values of hardness of single FCC and single BCC phases are about 110 and 500Hv, respectively, and are almost identical in both C-xand H-x. This implies that the hardness of Al–Ni-rich phase in H-0.375 to H-0.75 are similar to that of the BCC matrix phase in H-0.875 to H-2.00.","['fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5', 'fig4', 'fig3', 'fig6', 'fig4', 'fig5', 'fig6']","['tbl3', 'tbl4', 'tbl3', 'tbl4']"
3.2,Results and discussion.As-homogenized AlxCoCrFeNi (H-x),"By the same method discussed in the previous section and according to Eq.(1), the boundaries of the transition region and the volume fractions of FCC and BCC can be calculated and shown in Fig. 6 and listed in Table 3 . Thexinterval of the transition region for H-xthus calculated is 0.30≤x≤1.17, which is very near the interval of 0.375≤x≤1.00 discussed above from the microstructure study. In addition, it is observed for the transition region that the volume fraction of BCC phase is roughly proportional to the molar ratio of Al to the power of 3 and proportional to the atomic percent of Al to the power of 4 as shown in the fitting Eqs.(2) and (3).(2)Y=0.65Xm3+0.17,(3)Y=429.34Xa4+0.19,whereYis the volume fraction of BCC,Xmis the molar ratio of Al, andXais the atomic percent of Al.",['fig6'],['tbl3']
3.2,Results and discussion.As-homogenized AlxCoCrFeNi (H-x),"However, it was difficult for the two coexisted BCC phases (x≥1.25) to calculate their volume fractions. The volume fraction from EDS is a rough estimate. The overall Al at%, Altotal, is the sum of both the Al at% of BCC phases, AlBCC(matrix)and AlBCC(wall). The results for H-1.25 to H-2.00 are calculated by Eq.(4)and listed in Table 3 .(4)Altotal=xAlBCC(matrix)+(1−x)AlBCC(wall),",[],['tbl3']
3.3,Results and discussion.As-deformed AlxCoCrFeNi (D-x),"The samples of H-x(x=0, 0.25, 0.375, 0.50, 0.75, and 0.875) further deformed by rolling to 50% reduction in thickness are called D-x. Rolling is used in this study to induce numerous defects, such as dislocations and lattice distortion. Accordingly, the intensity of the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 7 drastically decrease to 300cps at least. The corresponding lattice constants are listed in Table 5 . However, SEM images shown in Fig. 8 and the EDS compositional analysis shown in Table 6 are almost identical to those of H-x.","['fig7', 'fig8']","['tbl5', 'tbl6']"
3.3,Results and discussion.As-deformed AlxCoCrFeNi (D-x),"Note that the volume fractions of FCC and BCC of D-xhere are assumed to be identical to the counterparts of H-x, i.e., no phase transformation occurs during 50%-cold rolling. The hardness of D-xshowing obvious deformation hardening effect is illustrated and compared with those of H-xin Fig. 9(a) and the detailed values and hardening ratio, HR, are listed in Table 5 . The hardening ratio, HR, is defined as:(5)HR=(HD-x−HH-x)HH-x,where theHD-xandHH-xare the values of hardness of D-xand H-x, respectively. In Fig. 9(a)  and (b), the slope of D-xin the transition region seems to be equal to that of H-xand the curve of volume fraction of BCC. This indicates that the hardness of D-xstill relates to the volume fractions of FCC and BCC. Fig. 9(c)  demonstrates the monotonically decreasing linear relationship for the hardness and HR to the volume fraction of FCC. This not only explains that the hardness and HR still are simply constituted by the deformation-hardened FCC and BCC but also shows that there are proportional deformation constant among them. Further, for D-xthe hardness can be written as follows:(6)HD-x=(CFCCHH-FCC)XFCC+(CBCCHH-BCC)XBCC,where theCFCCandCBCCare called as the deformation hardening constants,HH-FCCandHH-BCCthe average hardness values of prior-deformed single FCC and single BCC,XFCCandXBCCthe volume fractions of FCC and BCC, respectively. By numerical fitting, theCFCCandCBCCare 2.55 and 1.23, respectively. The result shows the hardening ability of FCC was about twice that of BCC in this high-entropy alloy system. Therefore, the hardness of H-xand D-xobeyed the molar ratio of Al to the power of 2.5–3 in Eq.(3).","['fig9', 'fig9', 'fig9']",['tbl5']

The ratio of hardening (HR) after 50%-deformation varies from 0.4 to 2.0 that decreases as the amount of Al increases. The main strengthening mechanism is work hardening.(5).The hardening ability of FCC was about twice that of BCC in this high-entropy alloy system.",[],[]
