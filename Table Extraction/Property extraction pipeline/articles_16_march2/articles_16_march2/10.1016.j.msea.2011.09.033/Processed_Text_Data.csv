0,Abstract,"A new refractory alloy, Nb20Cr20Mo10Ta10Ti20Zr20, was produced by vacuum arc melting. To close shrinkage porosity, it was hot isostatically pressed (HIPd) at T                     =1723K and P                     =207MPa for 3h. In both as-solidified and HIPd conditions, the alloy contained three phases: two body centered cubic (BCC1 and BCC2) and one face centered cubic (FCC). The BCC1 phase was enriched with Nb, Mo and Ta and depleted with Zr and Cr, and its lattice parameter after HIP was a                     =324.76±0.16pm. The BCC2 phase was enriched with Zr and Ti and considerably depleted with Mo, Cr and Ta, and its lattice parameter after HIP was estimated to be a=                     341.0±1.0pm. The FCC phase was highly enriched with Cr and it was identified as a Laves C15 phase, (Zr,Ta)(Cr,Mo,Nb)2, with the lattice parameter a                     =733.38±0.18pm. The volume fractions of the BCC1, BCC2 and FCC phases were 67%, 16% and 17%, respectively. The alloy density and Vickers microhardness were ρ                     =8.23±0.01g/cm3 and H                                             v                                          =5288±71MPa. The alloy had compression yield strength of 1595MPa at 296K, 983MPa at 1073K, 546MPa at 1273K and 171MPa at 1473K. During deformation at 296K and 1073K, the alloy showed a mixture of ductile and brittle fracture after plastic compression strain of ∼5–6%. No macroscopic fracture was observed after 50% compression strain at 1273K and 1473K. Phase transformations and particle coarsening considerably accelerated by the plastic deformation occurred in the temperature range of 1073–1473K.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Metallic alloys with superior mechanical properties at elevated temperatures and low density remain in high demand for the aerospace industry. For example, the specific core power of a high pressure turbine engine is known to increase with an increase in the turbine rotor inlet temperature and significant turbine engine efficiencies can be achieved by running at higher temperatures[1]. These applications have benefited from decades of development of nickel-based (Ni) superalloys, which have allowed a steady increase in operating temperatures and led to improved performance and efficiency[2]. Currently, Ni-based superalloys have the best combination of required elevated temperature properties, such as creep resistance, temperature capability, environmental resistance, and damage tolerance, among all other known alloys. However, operating temperatures are reaching the theoretical limits of these materials, whose incipient melting temperatures are in the range of 1440–1540K, depending on the composition. Engineering solutions to this materials problem require active or passive cooling thus increasing parasitic weight and decreasing overall flight efficiency and capability (maneuverability, fuel consumption, etc.) of supersonic/hypersonic vehicles. New metallic materials with higher melting points, such as refractory molybdenum (Mo) and niobium (Nb) alloys, are now being seriously examined as alternatives by academic and industrial groups[3–5].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The refractory metals and alloys, a group of metallic materials with melting points above 2123K, are creep resistant at temperatures above 1073K. High temperature strength and creep resistance are the key properties of these alloys, since considerable alloy softening generally occurs at temperatures above ∼0.5–0.6Tm, whereTmis the absolute melting temperature. At the same time, poor low-temperature ductility, poor oxidation resistance at high temperatures and high density limit the range of applications of many refractory alloys.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In recent publications[6–9]a new, so-called high entropy alloying (HEA) approach, invented by Yeh et al.[10–12], was used to develop new refractory alloys, which contain several principal alloying elements at near equiatomic concentrations. These are Ta25Nb25W25Mo25, Ta20Nb20W20Mo20V20[6,7]and Ta20Nb20Hf20Zr20Ti20[8,9]. All three alloys had a single-phase BCC crystal structure. The two alloys containing W, retained extremely high strength at temperatures at least up to 1873K; however, they were brittle at room temperature. At the same time, the Ta20Nb20Hf20Zr20Ti20alloy showed high strength and very good ductility at room temperature[8], however, the strength of this alloy rapidly decreased to below 100MPa at temperatures above 1473K and cavitation occurred during deformation atT∼1073K and strain rates above 10−3s−1[9]. Among these three alloys, the Ta20Nb20Hf20Zr20Ti20alloy had the lowest density of 9.8g/cm3. In the present paper, we report on a new lower density refractory alloy, Nb20Cr20Mo10Ta10Ti20Zr20. By replacing Hf and half of Ta in the Ta20Nb20Hf20Zr20Ti20alloy with lighter Cr and Mo, respectively, the density of the new alloy was reduced to 8.2g/cm3. In addition, the new alloy showed improved high temperature strength, relative to the Ta20Nb20Hf20Zr20Ti20alloy, and improved room temperature ductility, relative to the Ta25Nb25W25Mo25, Ta20Nb20W20Mo20V20alloys.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The Nb20Cr20Mo10Ta10Ti20Zr20(which is also called NbCrMo0.5Ta0.5TiZr) alloy was prepared by vacuum arc melting of the pure elements. Nb, Cr, Ti and Zr were taken at equal molar fractions, while the molar fractions of Mo and Ta were twice smaller. Titanium and zirconium were in the form of 3.175mm diameter slugs with purities of 99.98% and 99.95%, respectively. Niobium, tantalum and molybdenum were in the form of 1.0, 2.0 and 4.6mm diameter rods, and their purities were 99.95%, 99.9% and 99.0%, respectively. Chromium was in the form of 3–12mm pieces with the purity of 99.95%. High vacuum of 2.1×10−4N/m2was achieved in the arc melting chamber prior to filling the chamber with high purity argon at the pressure of 5.1×104N/m2. High purity molten titanium was used as a getter for residual oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen. Arc melting of the alloy was conducted on a water-cooled copper plate. To achieve homogeneous distribution of elements, the alloy was re-melted and flipped five times, and was in a liquid state for about 5min during each melting event. The prepared sample was about 15mm thick, 35mm wide and 100mm long and had shiny surfaces. The actual alloy composition determined with the use of inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), is given in Table 1 . The crystal structure was identified with the use of a Rigaku X-ray diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation, and the 2θrange of 5–140°.",[],['tbl0005']
2,Experimental procedures,"To close porosity in the as-solidified alloy, it was hot isostatically pressed (HIPd) under the following conditions. The alloy sample was placed inside a 63mm diameter alumina can. The alumina can was inserted inside a 75mm diameter graphite can, which was used as a heating element and located inside the HIP unit chamber. The chamber was evacuated to ∼1.3×10−4N/m2, filled with high purity argon and the sample was heated at a constant rate of 10K/min to 1723K with a simultaneous increase in the argon pressure in the chamber to 207MN/m2. The sample was held at 1723K/207MN/m2for 3h and cooled to room temperature at ∼20K/min with simultaneous pressure release.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The density of the alloy was measured with an AccuPyc 1330 V1.03 helium pycnometer. The pycnometer cell volume was 12.2284cm3, the weight of the sample was ∼10g and was measured with the accuracy of ±0.0001g, and the volume of the samples was determined with the accuracy of ±0.0001cm3by measuring the free volume of the loaded cell using helium gas and 10 purges. Vickers microhardness was measured on polished cross-section surfaces using a 136° Vickers diamond pyramid under 500g load applied for 30s. The microstructure was analyzed with the use of a scanning electron microscope (SEM) Quanta 600F (FEI, North America NanoPort, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) equipped with a backscatter electron (BSE), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) detectors. A step size of 0.2μm was used for simultaneous EDS and EBSD mapping.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Cuboids-shaped specimens for compression testing were electric-discharge machined from the HIPd alloy. The specimen compression axis was perpendicular to the alloy surface, which was in contact with the copper plate during arc melting. The specimen surfaces were mechanically polished and the compression faces of the specimens were paralleled and lubricated with boron nitride (for elevated temperature tests). The specimen's dimensions were ∼4.7mm×4.7mm×7.7mm. Compression tests were conducted at temperatures 1073K, 1273K and 1473K in a computer-controlled Instron (Instron, Norwood, MA) mechanical testing machine outfitted with a Brew vacuum furnace and silicon carbide dies. Prior to each test, the furnace chamber was evacuated to ∼10−4N/m2. The test specimen was then heated to the test temperature at a heating rate of ∼20K/min and soaked at the temperature for 15min under 5N controlled load, and then compressed to a 50% height reduction or to fracture, whichever happened first. A constant ramp speed that corresponded to an initial strain rate of 10−3s−1was used. Room temperature testing was conducted at the same loading conditions but in air, and a thin Teflon foil was used between the compression faces and silicon carbide dies to reduce friction. The deformation of all specimens was video-recorded and an optical setup was used to measure strain vs. load.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Crystal structure and microstructure of the as-solidified and HIPd alloy," Fig. 1 shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the NbCrMo0.5Ta0.5TiZr alloy in (a) as-solidified and (b) HIPd conditions. The diffraction peaks from three phases, two with the body centered cubic (BCC1 and BCC2) lattices and one with the face centered cubic (FCC, Laves C15) lattice, are easily identified in the as-solidified condition (see Fig. 1 a), and the lattice parameters of these phases were determined to bea=325.46±0.11pm, 338.6±0.4pm, and 733.38±0.18pm, respectively. The HIP processing broadened the X-ray peaks from the BCC1 and FCC phases and reduced the intensities of the peaks of the BCC2 and FCC phases relative to the peak intensities of the BCC1 phase ( Fig. 1 b), which increased errors in the measurements of the lattice parameters of these minor phases. The lattice parameter of the BCC1 phase slightly decreased (a=324.76±0.16pm), BCC2 phase increased (a=341±1pm) and FCC phase increased (a=740.0±0.5pm) after HIP.","['fig0005', 'fig0005', 'fig0005']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Crystal structure and microstructure of the as-solidified and HIPd alloy,"Microstructure of the HIPd alloy is shown in Fig. 2 . Three characteristic microstructural constituents are clearly recognized on the backscatter electron (BSE) images. These are (i) large branching bright particles, (ii) a dark continuous matrix between the bright particles, and (iii) smaller dark particles precipitated inside the matrix. Additionally, an about 3μm thick transition layer (TL) can be seen at the surfaces of the bright particles ( Fig. 2 b). The electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) analysis indicated that both the bright particles and the dark matrix, as well as the transition layer, have the BCC crystal structures, while the smaller dark particles have a FCC crystal structure ( Fig. 3 a and b). Note that in the secondary electron (SE) image mode ( Fig. 3 a), the light-gray color code of the FCC particles is similar to the color code of large BCC1 particles. Although the EBSD method cannot distinguish the BCC1 and BCC2 phases, which have different lattice parameters, these phases can be identified by comparing their volume fractions. Indeed, the volume fractions of the bright particles, dark particles and the matrix were determined to be ∼67%, 17% and 16%, respectively. Comparing these results with the results of the X-ray diffraction concludes that the bright particles have the BCC1 crystal structure, while the matrix phase has the BCC2 crystal structure. EDS mapping showed that these phases have different concentrations of alloying elements. For example, Fig. 3 c illustrates that the concentration of Ti is much higher in the BCC2 phase than in the BCC1 phase, while the FCC phase has the lowest concentration of Ti.","['fig0010', 'fig0010', 'fig0015', 'fig0015', 'fig0015']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Crystal structure and microstructure of the as-solidified and HIPd alloy,"Quantitative chemical analysis of these three phases was conducted with the use of an EDS detector attached to the field emission gun SEM. The results are given in Table 2 . It is found that the BCC1 phase is enriched with Nb, Mo and Ta, which are the BCC forming elements, and depleted with Cr and Zr. The amount of Ti in the BCC1 phase is close to the average alloy composition. The BCC2 phase, on the other hand, is highly enriched with Ti and Zr and depleted with Cr, Mo and Ta. The amount of Nb in this phase is only slightly lower of the average alloy composition. In spite of the reduced amount of the BCC-forming elements in the BCC2 phase, their total concentration is still high, ∼26at.%, thus stabilizing the high-temperature polymorph of the Ti and Zr rich phase. The FCC phase contains an increased amount of Cr (∼41at.%) and reduced amounts of Mo, Nb, Ta and Ti. This Laves phase can be described by a formula (Zr,Ta)(Cr,Mo,Nb)2, with Ti equally substituting both larger and smaller elements. Finally, the transition layer at the surface of the BCC1 particles has a reduced concentration of Cr and Mo and an increased concentration of Ti and Zr, relative to the composition of the interior part of these particles. The chemical composition of this layer is very different from the compositions of two other phases, BCC2 and FCC. Therefore, one may suggest that this layer retains the BCC1 crystal structure of the underneath particles.",[],['tbl0010']
3.1,Results and discussion.Crystal structure and microstructure of the as-solidified and HIPd alloy,"It is interesting to note that the inverse pole figure (IPF) maps from the BCC and FCC phases, Fig. 3 (d–f) show that the BCC2 matrix grains have the same crystallographic orientations as the adjacent BCC1 particles. On the other hand, no correlation between the crystallographic orientations of the BCC2 matrix and FCC particles was identified. This result may indicate that the BCC1 and BCC2 phases originate from the same high-temperature single BCC phase, i.e. just below the melting temperature the alloy has a single-phase BCC crystal structure. During cooling, this high-temperature BCC phase rejects Cr and Zr into the grain boundaries. Subsequently, the Cr and Zr enriched grain boundary regions experience the phase transformation resulting in formation of the Cr-rich FCC particles (Laves phase) and Zr- and Ti-rich continuous BCC2 phase. According to this scenario, the discontinuous BCC1 particles should be considered as the remaining high-temperature matrix phase and the continuous BCC2 phase as a secondary phase formed along the grain boundaries of the high-temperature BCC1 phase as a result of the solid-state phase transformation. Additional work is required for studying solid-state reactions in this alloy.",['fig0015'],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Crystal structure and microstructure of the as-solidified and HIPd alloy,"Using the rule of mixtures (i.e. Vegard's law[13]) and known concentrations of the alloying elements in the BCC1 and BCC2 phases, one can calculate the crystal lattice parameteramixof the respective disordered BCC solid solutions:(1)amix=∑ciaiHereciis the atomic fraction of elementiandaiis the lattice parameter of the BCC crystal lattice of elementiat room temperature. The calculated (Calc)amixare given in Table 3 along with the experimental (Exp)avalues determined from the X-ray diffraction. The calculated and experimental values ofafor the BCC1 phase are practically the same; however, the experimental value ofafor the BCC2 phase in the HIPd alloy is about 0.5% higher than the respective calculated value. This discrepancy can be due to a large experimental error in determiningafrom low-intensity X-ray diffraction peaks of the BCC2 phase. The same calculated and experimental values of the lattice parameter suggest that the alloying elements are randomly distributed in the BCC phases.",[],['tbl0015']
3.2,Results and discussion.Density and microhardness,"The density of the alloy in the as-solidified and HIPd conditions was determined to beρ=8.02±0.01g/cm3and 8.23±0.01g/cm3, respectively. A 2.6% increase in the alloy density after HIPing is probably due to closing the same volume fraction (∼2.6%) of the porosity, which was eventually present in the as-solidified material. Using the densities of pure elements ( Table 4 ) and the alloy composition ( Table 1 ), one can estimate the density,ρmix, of a disordered solid solution of the same composition using the rule of mixtures:(2)ρmix=∑ciAi∑ciAi/ρiHereAiandρiare the atomic weight and density of elementi. Thus calculatedρmixvalue is 8.23g/cm3, which is exactly the same as the density of HIPd alloy. The fact that the average alloy density follows the rule of mixtures of pure elements, in spite of the alloy contains 2 disordered BCC phases with the total volume fraction of 83% and one ordered FCC phase with the volume fraction of 17%, may indicate that the decomposition of the high-temperature single BCC phase into these three phases did not affect the average coefficient of thermal expansion and, thus, density of the alloy at room temperature.",[],"['tbl0020', 'tbl0005']"
3.2,Results and discussion.Density and microhardness,"Vickers microhardnessHvof the HIPd alloy was measured in twenty randomly selected locations and the average value was 5288MPa. The scatter around the average microhardness value was ΔHv=±71MPa. The microhardness of the alloy does not follow the rule of mixtures of the respective properties of the constituent elements. Indeed, Table 5 shows typicalHv[14]values for pure elements at room temperature. Using the rule of mixtures, the microhardness,(Hv)mix=∑ciHVi, was calculated to be (Hv)mix=1097MPa. This value is much smaller than the experimentalHvvalue. The high microhardness of the alloy is likely originated from the combination of precipitation and solid solution-like strengthening.",[],['tbl0025']
3.3.1,Results and discussion.Compression properties and microstructure of deformed alloy.Compression properties,"The engineering stress,σ, vs. engineering strain,ɛ, curves of the NbCrMo0.5Ta0.5TiZr alloy obtained during compression testing at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 4 . The yield strength values,σ0.2, atɛp=0.2%, whereɛpis the engineering plastic strain, peaks strength,σp, and fracture strain,ɛf, are given in Table 6 . During deformation at 296K, the yield strength was 1595MPa and continuous strengthening occurred until the alloy fractured by localized shear at the peak strength of 2046MPa accumulating about 5% strain. During testing atT=1073K,σ0.2decreased to 983MPa, the peak strength of 1100MPa was achieved at 4.2% strain and the sample fractured by shear at about 5.5–6% strain, after a decrease in strength to 1050MPa. An increase in the testing temperature to 1273K resulted in a considerable softening of the alloy after a short stage of strain hardening. At this temperature,σ0.2=546MPa,σp=630MPa and the minimum strength achieved during strain softening was 393MPa after about 22% plastic strain. At this temperature, the sample did not fracture. An increase in the temperature to 1473K, led to further decrease in the flow stress of the alloy andσ0.2was 170MPa. The peak stress of 190MPa was reached shortly after yielding and followed by weak softening and a steady state flow atσmin=135MPa. No sample fracture occurred at this temperature.",['fig0020'],['tbl0030']
3.3.2,Results and discussion.Compression properties and microstructure of deformed alloy.Microstructure of deformed samples,"Typical microstructure features of the fracture surface of the alloy sample deformed at room temperature are shown in Fig. 5 . A mixture of ductile and brittle fracture can be seen at low magnification in Fig. 5 a. The ductile fracture leads to formation of dimples of different sizes and morphology ( Fig. 5 (b,c)), while the brittle fracture occurs by quazi-cleavage of the FCC (Laves) phase, as well as along the interfaces ( Fig. 5 (a and d)).","['fig0025', 'fig0025', 'fig0025', 'fig0025']",[]
3.3.2,Results and discussion.Compression properties and microstructure of deformed alloy.Microstructure of deformed samples,"The brittle behavior of the Laves phase also led to low ductility at 1073K. Fracture at this temperature occurred along the boundaries between the BCC2 and Laves phases ( Fig. 6 (a–d)); however, few cracks propagated inside the large BCC1 particles can also be seen in Fig. 6 a and b. Fine (secondary) BCC1 nano-particles precipitated near the original (primary) large BCC1 particles inside the BCC2 phase are shown in Fig. 6 d. Their size rapidly decreases with an increase in the distance from the primary BCC1 particle, with which the small particles are associated. These secondary BCC1 nano-particles were not observed in non-deformed sample. It is likely that at 1073K the solubility of Nb, Mo and Ta in the BCC2 phase is considerably higher than at room temperature and the plastic deformation accelerates diffusion of the heavy elements from the primary BCC1 particle into the adjacent BCC2 matrix leading to partial dissolution of the BCC1 phase. The concentration of Nb, Mo and Ta is thus the highest near the primary particle interface and exponentially decreases with an increase in the distance from the interface. Upon cooling after testing, re-precipitation of the BCC1 phase occurs. Due to a strong temperature dependence of the solubility, the precipitation in the regions with higher concentration of the elements occurs at higher temperatures. This leads to formation of larger secondary particles near the primary BCC1 particles and smaller particles at larger distances. Knowing the width of the region,l, where the precipitation occurred (l∼6μm) and the time of the specimen holding at 1073K (t∼1000s) the effective diffusion coefficient,Deff, of these elements in the BCC2 phase during compression at 1073K can be estimated asDeff=l2/(2t)≈1.8×10−10cm2/s. This estimated value is about one order of magnitude higher than the reported diffusion coefficient of Nb at the same temperature in BCC Zr–Nb alloys[15]and more than 5 orders of magnitude higher than the reported self-diffusion coefficient of Nb[16]. However, the diffusivity of elements is known to considerably increase during plastic deformation[17]. It is necessary to point out that these secondary BCC1 nano-particles replace and extend the transition layer, which is present at the surfaces of the primary BCC1 particles in non-deformed samples ( Fig. 2 ). It is likely that the plastic deformation at 1073K accelerates dissolution of this layer in the adjacent BCC2 matrix and re-precipitation of the BCC1 nano-particles during the following cooling.","['fig0030', 'fig0030', 'fig0030', 'fig0010']",[]
3.3.2,Results and discussion.Compression properties and microstructure of deformed alloy.Microstructure of deformed samples,"A representative microstructure of the HIPd alloy after 50% compression at 1273K is shown in Fig. 7 . The primary BCC1 particles are compressed in the loading direction ( Fig. 7 a). No cracks or porosity are detected. Fine equiaxed secondary BCC1 particles precipitate inside the BCC2 matrix near the surfaces of the primary BCC1 particles, while the transition layer disappears, similar to the situation observed in the sample deformed at 1073K. However, these fine particles are coarser after deformation at 1273K (compare Fig. 7 b and Fig. 6 d), their average size is estimated to be ∼0.7–0.8μm, and no noticeable decrease in the secondary particle size is seen with an increase in the distance from the associated primary particle. In addition, many of these secondary particles are aligned in chains oriented about 45–65° to the compression direction and form characteristic tails at the respective primary particles (two tails are indicated by arrows in Fig. 7 c). Directions of these aligned chains of fine particle are likely associated with the directions of the local shear propagation. A round primary BCC1 particle sheared at about 45° to the compression direction is also seen in Fig. 7 a, and it is shown in Fig. 7 c at a higher magnification. On the opposite sides of this particle there are two tails of fine particles, which are oriented in slightly different directions. These observations indicate that the local plastic flow changes orientation in the deformed alloy sample within ∼100μm scale. They also indicate that the fine secondary BCC1 particles were formed during deformation and then moved away from the primary BCC1 particles due to localized plastic flow, or the regions of the BCC2 matrix, which were adjacent to the large BCC1 particles and enriched with Nb, Mo and Ta, were heavily deformed and moved away from the particle interfaces at 1273K, but the fine particles were formed inside these regions during cooling due to the temperature-dependent solubility. Additional work is required to identify the correct scenario of formation of the aligned chains of fine BCC1 particles. Fine, nanometer-size precipitates of the Laves phase are observed inside the primary BCC1 particles in the deformed sample ( Fig. 7 d). These precipitates are coarser at grain boundaries ( Fig. 7 d).","['fig0035', 'fig0035', 'fig0035', 'fig0030', 'fig0035', 'fig0035', 'fig0035', 'fig0035', 'fig0035']",[]

The microstructure of this sample looks similar to the microstructure of the HIPd sample (compare Fig. 2 and Fig. 8 a). Annealing at 1273K for 1460s did not dissolve the transition layer (TL) at the surfaces of the primary BCC1 particles. However, a higher magnification image ( Fig. 8 b) shows that the decomposition of this TL has just started and few secondary BCC1 particles are spotted adjacent to this layer. Nanometer-sized precipitates are observed inside the primary BCC1 particles ( Fig. 8 b); however, their size is much smaller than in the deformed sample ( Fig. 7 d). This comparison of the microstructure of the deformed and non-deformed samples clearly indicates that the plastic deformation accelerates diffusion-related processes, such as phase transformations and particle coarsening.","['fig0040', 'fig0010', 'fig0040', 'fig0040', 'fig0040', 'fig0035']",[]
3.3.2,Results and discussion.Compression properties and microstructure of deformed alloy.Microstructure of deformed samples," Fig. 9 illustrates the microstructure of the HIPd alloy after 50% compression at 1473K. Many primary BCC1 particles become elongated and some are severely deformed in the directions of plastic flow of the material ( Fig. 9 a). Similar to deformation at 1273K, these particles have characteristic tails oriented in the directions of local plastic flow (some of these tails are indicated by arrows in Fig. 9 a and c). However, while at 1273K these tails consist of fine separated secondary BCC1 particles embedded in the BCC2 phase, at 1473K the tails consist of larger size (∼2–3μm) coalesced BCC1 particles (see Fig. 9 c). Deformation of the BCC2 matrix results in recrystallization and formation of equiaxed grains ( Fig. 9 d). At the same time, the FCC (Laves) particles embedded in the BCC2 matrix remain practically non-deformed and still impede the plastic flow, as it is clearly seen in Fig. 9 b. Twins, observed inside some FCC particles, are probably annealing twins as they are also present in non-deformed samples. Fine precipitates observed inside the primary BCC1 particles become clearly visible due to coarsening. These precipitates decorate grain boundaries, but they are also present inside the grains (see Fig. 9 ). The EBSD analysis indicates that these precipitates have the FCC crystal structure ( Fig. 10 ) and are likely the Laves phase.","['fig0045', 'fig0045', 'fig0045', 'fig0045', 'fig0045', 'fig0045', 'fig0045', 'fig0050']",[]
3.3.2,Results and discussion.Compression properties and microstructure of deformed alloy.Microstructure of deformed samples,"The results of the EDS analysis of different microstructural constituents presented in the sample after compression at 1473K are given in Table 7 . The average composition of the sample, measured from the area of ∼6mm2, is almost the same as the average composition of the as-solidified ( Table 1 ) and HIPd ( Table 2 ) samples. Because these samples were randomly extracted from different regions of the arc-molten ingot, this result indicates no macrosegregation of elements in the ingot. Comparison of the concentrations of the alloying elements in different phases of the deformed and HIPd samples shows that, after compression at 1473K, the BCC2 phase becomes slightly enriched with Nb, Mo and Ta and depleted with Ti, Zr and Cr, while the FCC phase becomes slightly enriched with Mo and Cr and depleted with Zr. The composition of the primary BCC1-rich particles also slightly changes due to a slight (∼0.75at.%) increase in Zr and the same decrease in Ta. These particles in the deformed sample consist of two phases: major BCC1 and minor FCC (Laves), the latter is in the form of nano-precipitates ( Fig. 9 ). Because the precipitates are enriched with Cr, the remaining BCC1 phase is slightly depleted with this element (see Table 7 ). The small bright particles inside the tails (see Fig. 9 c), although they have the BCC1 crystal structure, have increased amounts of Zr and Ti and reduced amounts of Cr, Mo and Ta relative to the BCC1 phase of the large primary particles. The composition of these particles is close to the composition of the transition layer at the surfaces of the primary BCC1 particles in the non-deformed alloy (see Table 2 ). This result supports our earlier conclusion that these tail particles precipitate inside the transition regions between the primary BCC1 particles and the BCC2 matrix during or after deformation.","['fig0045', 'fig0045']","['tbl0035', 'tbl0005', 'tbl0010', 'tbl0035', 'tbl0010']"

Namely, nano-precipitation and coarsening of secondary BCC1 particles inside the BCC2 phase and FCC particles inside the primary BCC1 particles occur in this temperature range. Plastic deformation increases the rate of these transformations by several orders of magnitude, probably by creating high number density of excess vacancies[17].",[],[]
4,Conclusions,"A new refractory alloy, NbCrMo0.5Ta0.5Ti20Zr20, was produced and its crystal structure, microstructure, density, hardness and compression properties were determined in the as-solidified and HIPd condition. The alloy consisted of two disordered BCC1 and BCC2 phases and one ordered FCC (Laves C15) phase. After HIP at 1723K, 207MPa for 3h, the BCC1 phase was present in the form of large individual particles, which were surrounded by the BCC2 phase. Smaller particles of the Laves phase were present inside the BCC2 phase. The volume fractions of the BCC1, BCC2 and FCC phases were 67%, 16% and 17%, respectively. The HIPd alloy density wasρ=8.23g/cm3and the Vickers microhardness wasHv=5.29GPa. The alloy showed high yield strengths ofσ0.2=1595MPa, 983MPa, 546MPa, and 170MPa at 293K, 1073K, 1273K and 1473K, respectively. Ductile type fracture occurred after ∼5–6% compression strain at 293K and 1073K. Brittle Laves particles were responsible for the fracture at these temperatures. No fracture occurred during compression testing at 1273K and 1473K.",[],[]
