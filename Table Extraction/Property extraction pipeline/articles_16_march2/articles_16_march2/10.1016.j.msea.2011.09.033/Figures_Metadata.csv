fig0005,articles_all/10.1016.j.msea.2011.09.033/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,X-ray diffraction patterns of the NbCrMo0.5Ta0.5TiZr alloy in (a) as-solidified and (b) HIPd conditions. The indexed peaks belong to two BCC and one FCC crystal phases.
fig0010,articles_all/10.1016.j.msea.2011.09.033/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,"SEM backscatter electron images of a polished cross-section of the HIPd NbCrMo0.5Ta0.5TiZr alloy. The three phases (BCC1, BCC2 and FCC) with different morphologies and contrasts, as well as the transition layer (TL), are indicated."
fig0015,articles_all/10.1016.j.msea.2011.09.033/figures/gr3.jpg,Fig. 3,"(a) Secondary electron (SE) image, (b) phase map, (c) EDS map of Ti, and (d and e) inverse pole figure (IPF) maps of (d) the BCC and (e) FCC phases. In (b), the BCC phases are colored by red and the FCC phase is colored by green. In (c), the lighter regions are enriched and darker regions are depleted with Ti. The crystallographic orientations of different grains in (d) and (e) are identified by the color scheme in the IPF triangle (f).
