Pressure-composition-isotherms (PCIs) demonstrate that CoFeMnTi                        x                     VZr, CoFeMnTiV                        y                     Zr, and CoFeMnTiVZr                        z                      can absorb and desorb hydrogen for x, y, and z that satisfy 0.5 ≤ x ≤ 2.5, 0.4 ≤ y ≤ 3.0, and 0.4 ≤ z ≤ 3.0, respectively. X-ray diffraction (XRD) reveals that CoFeMnTi                        x                     V                        y                     Zr                        z                      alloys have a simple C14 Laves phase with a single set of lattice parameters before and after PCI tests. The distributions of each element in CoFeMnTi                        x                     V                        y                     Zr                        z                      alloys are roughly equal, as revealed by SEM/EDS mapping. The effects of values x, y, and z on the hydrogen storage properties are elucidated in terms of lattice constant, element segregation, hydride formation enthalpies of the alloy components and hydrogen, and the averaged formation enthalpy. The high-entropy effect promotes the formation of a single C14 Laves phase, and the maximum hydrogen storage capacity is strongly related to the hydride formation enthalpy of the alloy and hydrogen.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The greenhouse effect is principally caused by the emission of CO2and is causing climate change, according to several studies[1,2]. Various green energies, without CO2emission, including hydrogen, solar, wind power, biomass, terrestrial heat, sea tide, and ocean thermal conversion (OTC) energies, have been widely explored. Hydrogen energy is effective and convenient. Moreover, solutions for reducing the cost of production of hydrogen are being developed and improved[3]. However, the storage of hydrogen is an important issue because of the flammability of hydrogen. The various techniques of hydrogen storage involve high-pressure hydrogen, adiabatic liquid hydrogen, carbon hydride, and metal hydride. In recent years, as a result of its safety, low cost, lack of production of non-greenhouse gases, high storage capacity per volume, and high absorption/desorption reversibility, metal hydride has been regarded as an excellent hydrogen storage material. LaNi5is a commercially available metal hydride.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The increase in the number of components in hydrogen storing alloys has recently become a major developing direction in improvement of the hydrogen storage properties – especially hydrogen absorption, hydrogen desorption and cycle life. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) satisfy the above-mentioned basic hydrogen storage requirements as proposed and demonstrated by Yeh and Chen, respectively, as shown in their student's master theses[4,5]. In the last ten years, the physical and chemical characteristics of HEAs have been extensively studied. HEAs comprise at least five elements, each with a concentration of between 5 and 35at%. In a multi-principal-element design, elements in alloy are well mixed in a liquid state at high temperatures, such yielding high entropy, and reducing the Gibbs free energy of the alloy system. HEAs tend to form a simple phase. Upon the thorough mixing of alloy elements, based on Boltzmann’s hypothesis[6], the change in the Gibbs free energy of the alloy elements (ΔGmix) and the change in configurational entropy of alloy elements (ΔSmix) are given by the following equations.ΔSmix=−klnΩ=−R∑xilnxi,ΔGmix=ΔHmix−TΔSmix,wherek,Ω,R,xi, ΔHmix, andTare the Boltzmann constant, the number of mixed states, the gas constant, the mole fraction of each element, the change in enthalpy from alloy elements, and absolute temperature, respectively. When the number of components (n) ≥ 5, ΔSmix≥ 1.61 R for equimolar alloy systems. However, the alloy is melted at high temperature. Assume arbitrarily that the alloy melts at 1650 K, andTΔSmix≥ 2.66 × 103R. Moreover,TΔSmixincreases withn. Therefore,TΔSmix, determined by the increase in “n”, competes with (i.e., being comparable with or greater than) ΔHmix, such that the formation of a simple microstructure of a five-element or more than five-element alloy is more likely than that of a three- or four-element alloy. HEAs have better properties than conventional alloys. They have simple microstructures in the form of a solid solution of multiple elements[7–9], a favorable capacity to form nano-scale precipitates[8,10,11], high thermal stability[12], superior extensive or compressive properties[13], extremely high hardness[14], excellent anticorrosive properties[13,14], and special electrical and magnetic properties[15].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"This study explores multi-principal-component hydrogen storage alloys to examine the effect of the multicomponents on their hydrogen storage characteristics. From the various combinations of elements, equimolar CoFeMnTiVZr was selected as a candidate alloy system. Equimolar CoFeMnTiVZr high-entropy alloy has a single C14 Laves structure, and absorbs/desorbs hydrogen[16]. This study seeks to improve the hydrogen storage properties, optimizing the hydrogen storage capacity, the kinetic behavior, and the working temperature and pressure by modifying the Ti, V, and Zr contents of CoFeMnTixVyZrzalloys. Since most current studies are concerned with relatively light materials, rather than with heavy transition metals, at present a study at our laboratory focuses on the light metal high-entropy alloys for storing hydrogen. This study is part of the study of light metal high-entropy alloys for storing hydrogen.",[],[]
2,Experimental details,"As-cast CoFeMnTixVZr, CoFeMnTiVyZr, and CoFeMnTiVZrzalloys, hereinafter denoted as Tix, Vy, and Zrz, were prepared using a vacuum arc remelter with molar ratios of 0.5 ≤x≤ 2.5, 0.4 ≤y≤ 3.0, and 0.4 ≤z≤ 3.0, respectively. In melting, ingots were turned over once in each melting process, which is repeated at least two times to ensure that the alloys were in a well-mixed state. After sample preparation, the specimens were analyzed to determine their crystallinity, microstructure, and hydrogen adsorption/desorption performance using XRD (RIGAKU ME510-FM2), SEM/EDS (JEOL JSM840A with Oxford EDS system), and a Sieverts-type setup, respectively. A Cu target with a characteristic wavelength ofλ(Kα1) = 1.54056 Å was used, and the working voltage and the current were 30 kV and 20 mA, respectively. The lattice constants of C14 were determined by Cohen’s method[17]. The volume expansion,ɛ, is expressed as follows.(1)ɛ=ΔV/V0=(a2c−a02c0)/a02c0where ΔV,V0, anda,c,a0, andc0are the difference between the volumes after and before the tests, the original volume before the PCI tests, and the lattice constants after and before the PCI tests, respectively. Specimens were crushed and passed through a 100-mesh screen to undergo PCI and kinetic testing. Each sample was activated by heating to 400 °C at 40 atm for 2 h. Since the self-pulverization does not obviously affect the kinetics, the effect of particle size is not discussed herein. The PCI tests were conducted using a pressure range of 0.01–20 atm at 25 and 80 °C. The kinetic tests were carried out at an initial pressure of 9.58 atm at 25, 80, and 150 °C.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Evidence of retained hydrogen for hydrogenated samples by XRD,"For alloys Tixand Zrz, the XRD peaks shifted to leftward upon the PCI tests, as will be discussed in Section3.2. The shift in the XRD peaks may result from (i) the retained hydrogen in alloys, or (ii) the plastic deformation of the samples following hydrogenation. To identify the cause of this peak shift, XRD tests were performed on raw, hydrogenated, and dehydrogenated Zr1. A complete PCI test, including absorption and desorption processes, is considered to be a complete cycle of hydrogenation–dehydrogenation. After hydrogenation, the sample was removed from the chamber, and the XRD tests were performed immediately (as-hydrogenated). The dehydrogenation of sample Zr1progressed at 400 °C at 10−4atm for 2 h was followed by hydrogenation (as-dehydrogenated). (Hereinafter, unless otherwise specified, the sample “before the PCI test” is the as-cast one, and the sample “after the PCI test” is the as-hydrogenated one.)Fig. 1presents the XRD results for as-cast (raw), hydrogenated, and dehydrogenated Zr1. The (110) 2θpeaks of as-cast (raw), hydrogenated, and dehydrogenated samples are located at 36.01, 33.86, and 35.65°, respectively. Therefore, hydrogenation substantially increases the lattice constants of raw samples, while dehydrogenation only slightly increases them. The temperature at which dehydrogenation was performed (400 °C) is well below the annealing temperature of the sample (around 1000 °C). Therefore, samples undergo plastic deformation after dehydrogenation. However, a comparison with that of the as-cast sample reveals that the (111) peak of the dehydrogenated sample (36.01–35.65°) is shifted only a little, while that of the hydrogenated sample shifts considerably (36.01–33.86°). Therefore, in Section3.2, the peak shift of the samples upon the PCI test is attributed mainly to the retention of hydrogen, rather than plastic deformation.",['fig1'],[]
3.2,"Results and discussion.The crystallinity and microstructure of alloys Tix, Vy, and Zrz"," Figs. 2 –4present the XRD patterns of alloys Tix, Vy, and Zrz. They comprise a crystalline single C14 Laves phase both before and after the PCI tests ( Figs. 2 (a)–4(a)and Figs. 2 (b)–4(b), respectively), despite the wide ranges ofx,y, andzin 0.5 ≤x≤ 2.5, 0.4 ≤y≤ 3.0, and 0.4 ≤z≤ 3.0. Both the alloys and their corresponding hydrides are of the C14 Laves phase with a single set of lattice parameters, but with an XRD peak shift to the left for hydrides, indicating the expansion of the hydride lattices. According to previous studies of almost all high-entropy alloys studied to date[7–9], for example, multi-principal-element alloys whoseTΔSmixis comparable to the absolute value of ΔHmix, such that the change in Gibbs free energy upon alloy formation is negative and its absolute value is not high, favor the formation of a single solid solution because of this high-entropy effect.","['fig2', 'fig3', 'fig4', 'fig2', 'fig3', 'fig4', 'fig2', 'fig3', 'fig4']",[]
3.2,"Results and discussion.The crystallinity and microstructure of alloys Tix, Vy, and Zrz","Asxandzincrease, the (110) peaks of alloys Tixand Zrz, respectively, shift to the left ( Figs. 2 (a) and 4(a)), indicating that before the PCI tests, the lattice constants of the alloys Tixand Zrzincrease withxandz, respectively. However, the (110) peaks of Vy, shown inFig. 3(a), reveal no significant change and no clear relationship exists between the lattice constants and theyvalues before the PCI test. Ti and Zr have larger atomic radii than Co, Fe, Mn, and V in the alloys. Therefore, the addition of Ti or Zr,xorz, unlike the addition of V, specifying degree of significance influences the lattice constants. After the PCI tests, the (110) peaks of alloys Tixand Zrzalso shift to the left asxandzincrease, respectively, while those of alloys Vyshift a little asyincreases ( Figs. 2 (b)–4(b)). As for the as-cast samples, both Ti and Zr affect the hydride lattice constants more considerably than does V.","['fig3', 'fig2', 'fig4', 'fig2', 'fig3', 'fig4']",[]
3.3,"Results and discussion.Kinetics for alloys Tix, Vy, and Zrz"," Figs. 5 –7present the kinetics of hydrogen absorption of Tix, Vy, and Zrz, alloys at 25 and 80 °C, as well as the necessary time for these alloys to absorb 90% of their absorption capacity,t0.9, respectively. Thet0.9parameter is a convenient indicator for the estimation of the hydrogen absorption kinetics of alloys.Fig. 5(c) presents the kinetics of Tixat 25 and 80 °C. It reveals thatt0.9declines asxincreases in the range 0.5 ≤x≤ 2, but sharply increases asxincreases to 2.5. The hydrogen absorption rate in this case seems to be closely related to the size of the interstitial sites because of the increase in the amount of added Ti asxincreases in the range 0.5 ≤x≤ 2, because the shift in the XRD peaks of Tix, discussed in Section3.2, reveals the expansion of the lattice and the consequent enlargement of the interstitial sites. Therefore, the hydrogen absorption rate increases, with the addition of Ti forxin the range 0.5 ≤x≤ 2. However, the absorption rate abruptly declines asxpasses 3 (not shown inFig. 5(c)). This phenomenon is explained as follows. Ti readily forms oxides on the surface of alloy[18], and the addition of excess Ti forms “enough” Ti oxides on the alloy surface to retard the diffusion of hydrogen atoms. The kinetics of Tixat 80 °C are in a manner similar to their relationship at 25 °C. The kinetics at 80 °C reveal thatt0.9also declines asxincreases in the range 0.5 ≤x≤ 2, and raises sharply atx= 2.5. The value oft0.9at 25 °C exceeds that at 80 °C (Fig. 5(c)), because the diffusion rate of hydrogen atoms in these alloys increases with temperature.","['fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5', 'fig6', 'fig7']",[]
3.3,"Results and discussion.Kinetics for alloys Tix, Vy, and Zrz","No relationship exists betweent0.9andyin alloys Vyat either 25 or 80 °C, as shown inFig. 6(a) and (b). The addition of V, but not Ti or Zr, affects the lattice constant of alloys Vyonly slightly because its radius is close to the average radius of Co, Fe, Mn, Ti, V, and Zr. Therefore, the addition of V only slightly influences the interstitial sites of alloys Vy. The value oft0.9for alloys Vyranges from 45 to 88 s, while that for alloys Tixranges from 25 to 1250 s. Therefore,t0.9is more sensitive to Ti than to V. Additionally,t0.9for Vyat 25 °C is less than that at 80 °C (Fig. 6(c)). Accordingly, the hydrogen kinetics of alloys Vyare faster at lower temperatures. This unusual phenomenon has also been observed in ZrMn3.8alloy[19]. The mechanism of this effect warrants further study.","['fig6', 'fig6']",[]

The effect of temperature ont0.9is similar to that for Vy.","['fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7']",[]
3.4.1,"Results and discussion.PCI curves of alloys Tix, Vy, and Zrz.Maximum hydrogen storage capacity","Fig. 8(a) plots the PCI curves of alloys Tixat 25 °C. The maximum hydrogen storage capacity, (H/M)max, increases withxin the range 0.5 ≤x≤ 2.0. Alloy Ti2has the largest (H/M)max, which is 1.8 wt%. However, (H/M)maxsharply falls to 1.2 wt% atx= 2.5. As shown inFig. 8(b), the relationship between (H/M)maxandxat 80 °C is the same as at 25 °C. Restated, (H/M)maxat 80 °C increases withxin the range 0.5 ≤x≤ 2.0, but declines sharply atx= 2.5. Since Ti is a strong hydrogen absorption element, adding Ti increases the affinity between alloys and hydrogen. Nevertheless, severe segregation occurs when excess Ti is added, as in Ti2.5. From the SEM/EDS mapping of alloy Ti1inFig. 11, all elements are roughly uniformly distributed in alloy Ti1, except for some slight segregation of Ti and Zr. In alloy Ti2.5, shown inFig. 12, Ti apparently segregates. The presence of a region that is lacking in Ti and Zr, caused by the segregation of Ti and Zr, is believed to reduce the overall size of the effective region of hydrogen absorption. Hence, (H/M)maxdeclines atx= 2.5. Additionally, (H/M)maxusually declines as temperature increases because the absorption of hydrogen is an exothermic reaction. ComparingFig. 8(a) with 8(b)shows that the values of (H/M)maxat 25 °C exceeds those at 80 °C for 0.5 ≤x≤ 2.0. The value of (H/M)maxat 25 °C (1.2 wt%) is lower than that at 80 °C (1.3 wt%) atx= 2.5, suggesting that the surface oxides of alloy Ti2.5are decomposed at 80 °C in a high-pressure environment. Consequently, the (H/M)maxof alloy Ti2.5is abnormally larger at 80 °C than at 25 °C.Fig. 9(a) and (b) plots the PCI curves of alloys Vyat 25 and 80 °C, respectively. The values of (H/M)maxrange from 1.4 to 1.6 wt% and from 0.75 to 1.25 wt% at 25 and 80 °C, respectively. No clear relationship exists between (H/M)maxandyvalue at 25 or 80 °C. Alloy V2.6at 25 °C has the highest value of (H/M)max. The (H/M)maxvalues at 25 °C exceed those at 80 °C.Fig. 10(a) and (b) plots the PCI curves of alloys Zrzat 25 and 80 °C, respectively. InFig. 10(a), the (H/M)maxvalues at 25 °C greatly increase withzin the range 0.4 ≤z≤ 1.6, but only slightly increase withzforz> 1.6. Like Ti, Zr is a strongly hydrogen-absorbing element. Therefore, (H/M)maxdepends onzfrom 0.4 to 1.6. However, Zr also tends to segregate in alloy[20]. Whenz> 1.6, the serious segregation of Zr reduces (H/M)max.Fig. 13presents the SEM/EDS mapping of Zr3, indicating serious segregation of Zr. As for alloys Vy, the (H/M)maxvalues of alloys Zrzat 25 °C exceed those at 80 °C.","['fig8', 'fig8', 'fig11', 'fig12', 'fig8', 'fig9', 'fig10', 'fig10', 'fig13']",[]
3.4.1,"Results and discussion.PCI curves of alloys Tix, Vy, and Zrz.Maximum hydrogen storage capacity","(H/M)maxis directly related to the enthalpy of formation of the alloy elements and hydrogen. Ti, V, and Zr are strongly hydrogen-absorbing elements because of their large negative hydride-forming enthalpies. The enthalpies of formation of ZrH2, TiH2, and VH are −162.8, −123.8, and −37.4 kJ/mol H2, respectively. Ti and Zr are more effective than V in improving (H/M)maxfor a given molar ratio. However, although the enthalpy of formation ZrH2is more negative than that of TiH2, the highest (H/M)maxis that of Tix(1.82 wt%) and not that of Zrz(1.80 wt%) because the segregation of alloys Zrzis more serious than that of Tix.",[],[]

In the PCI curves of alloys Ti1.5–2.5, the plateau pressures decrease withx. As displayed inFig. 8(b), the plateau pressure at 80 °C also declines asxincreases in the range 1.5 ≤x≤ 2.5. Based on the effect of atomic size on interstitial sites, discussed above, adding Ti is expected to reduce the plateau pressure. Additionally, an increase in temperature usually increases the plateau pressure of the alloy.

Comparing the right-hand ends of the PCI curves of alloys inFig. 8(a) reveals that the amount of hydrogen absorbed in Tixincreases withxin 0.1–10 atm. The absorption hydrogen is also evidenced by the volume expansion, revealed by XRD. Table 1 lists the volume expansion of Tixafter the PCI test, which increases withx. This phenomenon is related to the atomic radius of Ti and the enthalpy of formation of TiH2, which is −123.8 kJ/mol H2, so the strong affinity between Ti and H makes hydrogen desorption very difficult, and thus increases hysteresis. Additionally, the amount of hydrogen absorbed by Tixat 80 °C is slightly less than at 25 °C, as determined by comparingFig. 8(a) with 8(b).","['fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8']",['tbl1']

3.5,Results and discussion.Thermodynamic analysis,"In this study, the enthalpy of formation of metal hydride is calculated using the averaged enthalpy of formation method[21]. The calculated averaged enthalpy of formation, ΔHcal, can be expressed as follows.(2)ΔHcal=[(∑XiΔHi)(Hatom/Matom)max]/(Hatom/Matom)calwherexi, ΔHi, (Hatom/Matom)max, and (Hatom/Matom)calrepresent the molar fraction of each alloy element, the enthalpy of formation generated from alloy element “i” and hydrogen, the experimentally determined maximum hydrogen storage capacity, and the maximum hydrogen storage capacity calculated by averaging over the hydrides of individual components of the alloy, respectively. (Hatom/Matom)max, and (Hatom/Matom)calcan be abbreviated as (H/M)maxand (H/M)cal, or simply (H/atom)maxand (H/atom)cal, respectively. (H/M)calcan be regarded as a hydrogen coordination number of an alloy. In this approximation, the enthalpy of alloy mixing is neglected because it is smaller than the hydride formation enthalpy in most cases.

A plot of (H/atom)maxagainst ΔHcalis linear for A2B and AB5alloy systems, but spreads over a wide range and is highly non-linear for Tix, Vy, and Zrz, AB and AB2alloy systems. Therefore, the hydrogen coordination numbers of AB and AB2are more sensitive to composition than those of A2B and AB5, because the lattices of AB and AB2slowly change from ordered to disordered upon compositional change. Owing to significant difference between (H/M)caland (H/M)max, the fitted slopes of (H/atom)maxagainst ΔHcalvary over a wide range for AB and AB2alloy systems. Moreover, the fitted slopes for Mg2Ni and LaNi5are lower than those of the AB2alloy system. That is, for a given ΔHcal, the (H/atom)maxvalues of Mg2Ni and LaNi5exceed those of AB and AB2implying that Mg2Ni and LaNi5can retain a large quantity of hydrogen without a highly negative ΔHcal.

Adding Zr or Ti enlarges the interstitial sites of the alloys, and expands of the lattice. Therefore, thet0.9values of alloys Zrzand Tixdecrease aszandxincrease, respectively. The plateau pressures of alloys Zrzand Tixalso decrease withzandx, respectively.",[],[]
4,Conclusions,"(H/atom)maxis a linear function of ΔHcalfor A2B and AB5alloy systems, but is highly non-linear for Tix, Vy, Zrz, AB, and AB2. (H/atom)maxis strongly related to ΔHcalfor Tix, Vy, and Zrz.",[],[]
