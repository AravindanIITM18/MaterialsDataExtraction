0,Abstract,"A refractory high-entropy alloy HfNbTaTiZr was successfully rolled at room temperature up to 86.4% reduction in thickness (true thickness strain is −2.3). This represents the first successful attempt to cold roll a HEA with a BCC crystal structure. The microstructure and properties of the rolled sheets were determined in the as-rolled condition and after annealing at 800 °C, 1000 °C, and 1200 °C. Cold rolling resulted in extensive grain elongation, formation of deformation bands within the grains, and development of crystallographic textures that depended on the rolling reduction. The 86.4% cold-rolled sheet had true tensile stress of 1295 MPa and tensile ductility of 4.7%. After annealing at 1000 °C and 1200 °C, complete recrystallization of the cold-rolled sheet occurred. After annealing at 1000 °C, the true tensile stress and ductility of the sheet were 1262 MPa and 9.7%, respectively.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Refractory metals and alloys, a group of materials with melting points above 1850 °C, typically exhibit excellent high-temperature strength and creep resistance. Because strength is generally retained at temperatures below ∼0.5–0.6Tm, (Tm= the absolute melting temperature), the service temperatures of these alloys can be substantially greater than those of other metallic structural materials. However, poor low-temperature ductility and high-temperature oxidation resistance, in addition to their high density, limit their range of application. Recently, the multi-principal-element or high-entropy-alloy strategy[1–4]has been applied to develop a new class of refractory alloys with unique structural properties[5–13]. Some of these materials have shown good room-temperature ductility[7,9,12,14], high strength at elevated temperatures[6,13,15], and improved oxidation resistance[10,16,17]. In particular, the equi-atomic alloy HfNbTaTiZr exhibited homogeneous plastic flow and marked strain hardening during compression at room temperature[7,9,18]. Microstructural analysis showed that this material had a single-phase BCC structure with a lattice parametera= 0.3404 nm in both the as-cast condition as well as after annealing at 1200 °C for 24 h. The as-cast microstructure consisted of dendritic colonies that transformed during annealing to an equiaxed structure with an average grain size of ∼140 μm. Homogeneous plastic flow and excellent ductility during room-temperature compression were rationalized on the basis of strain hardening originating from solid-solution strengthening and extensive deformation twinning[7].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In the present work, the excellent ductility of HfNbTaTiZr in compression was utilized to produce thin sheet by cold rolling. The deformation behavior during cold rolling as well as the microstructure and mechanical properties of the rolled sheet in the as-deformed and rolled-and-annealed conditions are reported here.",[],[]
2,Material and experimental procedures,"The HfNbTaTiZr alloy was prepared by vacuum-arc (button) melting of an equiatomic mixture of the corresponding elements. Details of the synthesis technique have been given elsewhere[7]. The button was ∼10 mm in thickness and ∼50 mm in diameter, and had a measured composition summarized inTable 1. It was hot-isostatically pressed (HIP'ed) in high-purity argon at 1200 °C/207 MPa for 2 h and then annealed at 1200 °C for 24 h. A rectangular preform measuring 24-mm length×10.4-mm width×7.1-mm thickness was extracted from the mid-section of the button; its surfaces were finish-ground using 800 grit silicon-carbide paper.",[],['tbl1']
2,Material and experimental procedures,"Flat (sheet) rolling was conducted at room temperature using a two-high mill with 203-mm diameter rolls. The mill was equipped with a load cell under each screw-down that enabled the determination of the roll-separating force (P). The linear rolling speed was 101.6 mm/s, which resulted in an average effective strain rate of ∼0.84 s−1for the imposed per-pass thickness reduction of ∼5%. After every pass, the sample was rotated 180° around the normal direction. Rolling by this means was continued until ∼70% total reduction after which the reduction per pass was gradually increased to 10% until reaching a final total reduction of 86.4%. Samples for characterization were extracted at 65% thickness reduction (i.e., von Mises effective strainε¯= 1.2) and at 86.4% thickness reduction (effective strainε¯= 2.3).",[],[]
2,Material and experimental procedures,"The peak rolling load,Pi, for each passiwas used to estimate the von Mises effective (flow) stressσ¯iper the following relation[19,20]:(1a)σ¯i=3PiQi2(exp(Qi)−1)wiR′(ti−ti−1)in which(1b)Qi=2μR′(ti−ti−1)ti+ti−1,(1c)Ri′=R[1+16(1−ν2)PiEπwi(ti−ti−1)]",[],[]

2,Material and experimental procedures,"The errors in measuringσ¯iandε¯iwere ∼4% and 0.2%, respectively, at the beginning of rolling and increased to ∼10% and 1%, respectively, at the end of rolling, mainly due to the accuracy of the thickness measurements (10 μm).",[],[]
2,Material and experimental procedures,"Small sections of the samples rolled to 65% and 86.4% thickness reduction were encapsulated in quartz tubes backfilled with argon and annealed for 2 h at 800 °C, 1000 °C, or 1200 °C followed by cooling at a constant rate of 15 °C/min to room temperature. Phase analysis was performed via x-ray diffraction using a Bruker D2 diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation. The microhardness was measured on polished sections using a 136-degree Vickers (diamond-pyramid) indenter by applying a 500-g load for 20 s. The microstructures of polished longitudinal cross-sections of the rolled samples were determined using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with backscatter-electron (BSE), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and electron-backscatter-diffraction (EBSD) detectors. For the texture analysis, a set of EBSD scans from an area containing more than 100 grains was obtained and then stitched together. The room-temperature mechanical properties of sheet rolled to a total reduction of 86.4% were established by tension tests along the rolling direction. The test samples had a dog-bone shape with a reduced section measuring 0.96 mm × 2.8 mm with a gage length of 10 mm. The tests were conducted at a constant crosshead speed of 0.01 mm/s, corresponding to an initial strain rate of 10−3s−1.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Flow behavior during rolling of HfNbTaTiZr,"The plastic flow-behavior deduced from measured rolling loads revealed a strain-hardening transient at low strains followed by essentially steady-state flow at moderate to large strains. For example,Fig. 1summarizes the dependence of the true (effective) flow stress,σ¯, on true (effective) strain,ε¯, during cold rolling of the program alloy. Each solid circle in the figure corresponds to the stress/strain value during the respective rolling pass. Black circles indicate the rolling behavior until the 65% thickness reduction was achieved. The red circles denote the rolling behavior of the sheet during subsequent rolling to 86.4% total thickness reduction. During the first four passes,σ¯increased rapidly to 1318 MPa. During the next 8 passes, it increased slowly to 1395 MPa and then retained an almost constant value of 1395 ± 27 MPa until the end of the rolling process, at whichε¯≈ 2.3 had been achieved.",['fig1'],[]
3.2,Results.Microhardness of the rolled sheet,"Measurements on longitudinal cross-sections as a function of distance from the sheet surface for as-rolled samples (rolled to a total reduction of 65% or 86.4%) and rolled-and-annealed samples indicated a relatively uniform level of microhardness throughout the sheet thickness (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the average microhardness of the as-rolled samples (Table 2), i.e., Hv = 366 and 367, for the lower and higher total reductions, respectively, was only slightly higher than that before rolling, i.e., Hv = 360. Post-rolling annealing at 800 °C resulted in an increase in Hv to 374–376, while annealing at 1000 °C led to a decrease in Hv to 347–350. Annealing at 1200 °C had almost no effect on the hardness of the rolled sheets (Table 2).",['fig2'],"['tbl2', 'tbl2']"
3.3,Results.Tensile properties of the rolled sheet,"Fig. 3shows true stress – true strain curves of samples extracted from sheet in three conditions: (a) as-cold rolled to 86.4% thickness reduction, (b) rolled and annealed at 800 °C for 2 h, and (c) rolled and annealed at 1000 °C for 2 h. The tensile properties of these samples are given inTable 3. The as-rolled sample showed a yield stress (σ0.2) of 1202 MPa, peak stress (σp) of 1295 MPa (achieved at 0.027 strain), and total true strain (εf) of 0.047. Furthermore, this sample showed a noticeable softening stage without evidence of macroscopic strain localization. Annealing at 800 °C resulted in an increase in σ0.2and σpto 1303 MPa and 1334 MPa, respectively, although the total true strain decreased to 0.019. After annealing at 1000 °C for 2 h, the cold-rolled sheet showed a very attractive combination of tensile properties: σ0.2= 1145 MPa, σp= 1262 MPa, and εf= 0.097 (10% elongation). Plastic deformation of this sample occurred with a modest rate of strain hardening. The strain hardening coefficient γ (Δσ/Δε) was 900 ± 100 MPa. The measured elastic modulus of the as-rolled sheet was 93.3 GPa, while after annealing it increased slightly to 100 GPa.",['fig3'],['tbl3']
3.4,Results.Microstructure and texture of as-cold-rolled sheets,"In previous work[7,9], the HfNbTaTiZr alloy which had been HIP'ed and annealed at 1200 °C was found to have a single-phase BCC crystal structure with a lattice parametera= 0.3404 nm. Its microstructure consisted of equiaxed, dendritic grains with an average size of ∼140 μm. In the present work, the single-phase BCC crystal structure was retained after cold rolling, but the lattice parameter increased slightly toa= 0.3409 nm ± 0.0005 nm (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, the grains were heavily deformed and elongated in the rolling direction (Fig. 5a). Extensive deformation banding (inclined to the rolling direction at angles between ∼5° and 60°) was also seen within the grains (Fig. 5b). The deformation bands were especially noticeable on EBSD image-quality maps as black lines inside individual grains because the crystallographic orientations of the bands were poorly indexed as a result of very-high dislocation density (Fig. 6a andFig. 7a). An increase in the rolling deformation from 65% to 86.4% resulted in more-extensive elongation of the grains in the rolling direction and grain fragmentation (e.g.,Fig. 6b vs.Fig. 7b), likely associated with a subdivision of the grains into cell blocks and domains[21,22].","['fig4', 'fig5', 'fig5', 'fig6', 'fig7', 'fig6', 'fig7']",[]
3.4,Results.Microstructure and texture of as-cold-rolled sheets,"Moderately-strong textures were associated with the evolution of microstructure. After 65% reduction, for example, inverse pole figures revealed <111> and <001> parallel to the normal direction (ND), with <001>, <011>, and a small fraction of <112> in the rolling direction (RD) and transverse direction (TD) of the sheet (Fig. 8a). Thus the principal texture components were deduced to consist of {001}<100> (cube), {001}<110> (rotated cube), and {111}<011> (γ-fiber). A very weak {111}<112> (γ-fiber) component was also identified.",['fig8'],[]
3.4,Results.Microstructure and texture of as-cold-rolled sheets,"The preferred crystallographic orientations were noticeably modified with an increase in the rolling reduction to 86.4% (Fig. 8b). In particular, the intensity of the <001> || ND decreased by ∼5 times, thereby becoming very weak, the magnitude of <011> || RD doubled, and the intensity of the <111> || ND component did not change, per a comparison of the inverse pole figures inFig. 8a and b. In addition, a <213> || TD component developed at the higher reduction. Therefore, only two rolling-texture components were identified after rolling to the 86% thickness reduction, i.e., a strong {111}<011> and a very weak {100}<011>.","['fig8', 'fig8']",[]
3.5.1,Results.Microstructure of cold-rolled sheets after annealing.Sheet annealed at 800 °C,"Per the x-ray-diffraction analysis, annealing of rolled sheet at 800 °C for 2 h transformed the single-phase BCC material into a two-phase structure comprising BCC1 and BCC2 phases with lattice parametersa1= 0.3427 nm anda2= 0.3338 nm, respectively (Fig. 4b). BSE images taken from longitudinal cross-sections of 65% and 86.4% cold-rolled sheet revealed partially-recrystallized microstructure with fine second-phase particles precipitated inside non-recrystallized grains, often along deformation bands (Figs. 9 and 10). Second-phase particles were not present inside the recrystallized grains.Fig. 11a and b show the crystallographic orientations of recrystallized and non-recrystallized grains, as well as second phase particles, along the transverse and normal directions, respectively, of the sheet rolled to the 86.4% reduction. The corresponding image-quality (IQ) map for this region (Fig. 11c) allowed identification of the non-recrystallized grains. Dark lines on the IQ map corresponded to matrix/second-phase-particle interfaces, as well as the retained deformation bands; and light regions revealed the defect-free, recrystallized grains. While most of the non-recrystallized grains had preferred orientations of <001> and <111> in ND, the recrystallized grains did not. In addition, many of the second-phase particles had crystal orientations similar to that of the parent (matrix) grains.","['fig4', 'fig11', 'fig11', 'fig9', 'fig10']",[]
3.5.1,Results.Microstructure of cold-rolled sheets after annealing.Sheet annealed at 800 °C,"Chemical analysis revealed that the recrystallized grains were slightly enriched in Hf and Zr, while the particles were slightly enriched in Ta and Nb (Table 4). The composition of the non-recrystallized grains with second-phase particles was close to the average composition of the alloy. In light of the fact that the atomic radii of Hf and Zr are considerably larger than those of the other alloying elements, it was surmised that the matrix had the BCC1 structure (i.e., the phase with the larger lattice parameter), and the particles comprised the BCC2 crystal structure.",[],['tbl4']

The alloy comprised a single-phase BCC structure with a lattice parameter similar to that of the material prior to rolling (Fig. 4c). Many grains had preferred <111> orientations parallel to the normal direction of the sheet (Fig. 13a, b), and the majority of the grain boundaries had misorientation angles above 10° (Fig. 13c). The average grain size in samples that had been rolled to 65% and 86.4% reduction was 35 ± 5 μm and 22 ± 3 μm, respectively.","['fig12', 'fig4', 'fig13', 'fig13']",[]
3.5.3,Results.Microstructure of cold-rolled sheets after annealing.Sheet annealed at 1200 °C,"After annealing at 1200 °C for 2 h, the cold-rolled sheets retained their single-phase BCC crystal structure, and the x-ray-diffraction patterns were similar to that shown inFig. 4c. The annealed material exhibited an equiaxed grain structure with average size of ∼91 μm or 76 μm for samples that had been rolled to 65% or 86.4% reduction, respectively (Fig. 14a, b). These grain sizes were ∼3 times larger than those after annealing at 1000 °C. Moreover, fine second-phase precipitates with a dendritic morphology were observed within the recrystallized grains and at the grain boundaries (Fig. 14c, d). Because of their small size and volume fraction, the composition and crystal structure of these precipitates could not be identified by SEM/EDS/EBSD.","['fig4', 'fig14', 'fig14']",[]
3.5.4,Results.Microstructure of cold-rolled sheets after annealing.Effect of annealing on crystallographic texture of cold-rolled sheet,"As noted above, only two texture components were identified in the 86.4% cold-rolled sheet: a strong {111}<011> component and a weak {100}<011> component (Fig. 8b). After annealing at 800 °C and 1000 °C, the <111> || ND texture retained the same intensity, but it became somewhat stronger after annealing at 1200 °C (Fig. 15). The intensity of the <011> || RD component decreased noticeably after annealing at 800 °C and 1200 °C, but was retained after annealing at 1000 °C.

3.6,Results.Fracture behavior of as-rolled and rolled-and-annealed samples,"Representative SEM images of the fracture surface of a broken tension sample extracted from as-rolled sheet (with an 86.4% thickness reduction) are shown inFig. 16. A transgranular, ductile-type of failure was evident. The entire fracture surface was covered by dimples suggesting that the cold-rolled sheet had excellent plasticity and failed by microvoid coalescence at areas of localized plastic strain.",['fig16'],[]
3.6,Results.Fracture behavior of as-rolled and rolled-and-annealed samples,"After annealing at 800 °C, the room-temperature fracture behavior of the cold-rolled sheet changed dramatically. The macroscopic ductilitydecreasedfrom ∼5% in the as-rolled condition to 1.9% after annealing at this temperature. At high magnification, the type of fracture was apparently the same as for the as-rolled condition, i.e., by and large, transgranular and ductile (Fig. 17). However, the fracture surface of the annealed material was rough and had a blocky appearance at low magnifications (Fig. 17a). Specifically, two types of fracture-surface regions were noted. In some areas, the dimples were large, deep, and clustered in characteristic massifs (Fig. 17b). In other regions, the dimples were finer and shallow, suggesting limited ductility here (Fig. 17c). Deep cracks perpendicular to the fracture surface (i.e., parallel to the tension direction) were found here.","['fig17', 'fig17', 'fig17', 'fig17']",[]

Moreover, the fracture surface had a mixed appearance, showing both ductile (transgranular and intergranular) fracture and brittle (intergranular) fracture (Fig. 18). Individual recrystallized grains were clearly seen on the fracture surface of the sample due to extensive cracking along the grain boundaries (Fig. 18a). The fracture surface exhibited a variety of dimple sizes and shapes, which suggested a non-uniform distribution of second-phase particles (e.g., fine precipitates such as those shown inFig. 14c, d) causing the nucleation and growth of microvoids. The brittle intergranular regions appeared to be indicative of weakened grain-boundary regions, perhaps due to the precipitation of low-strength second-phase films here.","['fig18', 'fig18', 'fig14']",['tbl3']
4.1,Discussion.Cold rolling behavior of HfNbTaTiZr,"The present work has shown that the high-entropy alloy (HEA) HfNbTaTiZr has excellent cold workability and can be rolled at room temperature to thin sheet without any evidence of failure. To the authors' knowledge, this represents the first report in the open literature of the successful cold rolling of an HEA with a BCC crystal structure; almost all prior efforts for BCC HEAs have revealed very limited room-temperature ductility[2]. The only exception to such observations has been the excellent ductility of the current program alloy (HfNbTaTiZr) when subjected touniaxialcompression. In this mode of deformation, the imposed strain was accommodated by extensive deformation banding and twinning, which gave rise to noticeable strain hardening[7].",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Cold rolling behavior of HfNbTaTiZr,"The uniaxial-compression flow curve for HfNbTaTiZr obtained at a nominal strain rate of 10−3s−1[7]was compared with the effective stress-strain behavior deduced from the present rolling-pressure measurements (Fig. 1). Despite an almost three orders of magnitude difference in strain rate, the flow-stress levels and strain-hardening rate for the two different modes of deformation were almost identical indicating a negligible value of the strain-rate sensitivity of the flow stress (min the relationσ–ε˙m) of this alloy at room temperature. This observation is in agreement with previous results[9], which indicated a very low value of m (∼0.01) during compression of HfNbTaTiZr at T = 800 °C and 10−3≤ε˙≤ 10−1s−1.",['fig1'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Cold rolling behavior of HfNbTaTiZr,"After strain hardening to a true strain of ∼0.56, the current work has also shown that this alloy exhibits steady-state flow at larger strains (with a true flow stress of 1395 ± 27 MPa) and can be cold deformed during cold rolling to very high strains (ε¯= 2.3) without any evidence of failure. Such behavior is very different from the strong strain-hardening behavior at low temperatures of BCC metals such as Ta, Nb, W, and Cr, but is typical of FCC metals for which a saturation flow stress is reached during high-strain forming operations[23]. The presence of steady-state flow typically implies that the microstructure (and substructure) are no longer changing significantly with strain due to a balance between strain hardening and dynamic recovery[23,24]. However, this does not appear to be the case in the present work in which considerable further elongation of grains and, more importantly, the formation of additional deformation bands inside the grains appeared to have proceeded well into the steady-state regime (e.g.,Fig. 6vsFig. 7).","['fig6', 'fig7']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Cold rolling behavior of HfNbTaTiZr,"One possible explanation for the origin of steady-state flow at large plastic strains for the present program alloy is the compensation of strain-hardening by texture softening due to grain rotations induced by deformation banding and/or twinning[25]. In this regard, a strong increase in the intensity of the {111}<110> texture and α-fiber (<110> || RD) components, as well as the disappearance of the {001}<110> component, were observed. Assuming that three slip systems, {110}<111>, {112}<111> and {123}<111>, all with the same critical resolved shear stress during cold deformation[26], are operative, Taylor factors of MR= 3.05 ± 0.46 and 3.09 ± 0.46 for plain strain rolling along the former rolling direction were calculated for the specific textures developed at 65% and 84.5% reduction, respectively. Thus, it can be concluded that texture softening did not occur. Additional study is therefore required to identify the deformation mechanism(s) responsible for the observed flow behavior.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Microstructures of annealed sheet,"According to the results of annealing trials following cold rolling, the HEA HfNbTaTiZr contains two BCC phases at 800 °C and a single BCC phase at both 1000 °C and 1200 °C. Because the large stored work introduced during rolling would have accelerated the development of equilibrium microstructure(s) during annealing, it can thus be concluded that the alloy comprises a single-phase BCC structure only at high temperatures. By contrast, the high temperature BCC phase separates into two BCC phases at temperatures between 800 °C and 1000 °C. Therefore, the single-phase BCC structure observed at room temperature before and after cold rolling should be considered as non-equilibrium. These conclusions are underscored by the fact that the initial single-phase structure was produced by annealing at 1200 °C for 24 h followed by furnace cooling. The single-phase BCC structure was also largely retained after annealing the rolled sheet at 1000 °C and 1200 °C followed by slow (controlled) cooling at 15 °C/min, albeit a very small volume fraction (∼1–2%) of second-phase precipitates was detected in sheet annealed at the higher of these two temperatures. This indicates that the alloy requires a very slow cooling rate (less than 15 °C/min) for the decomposition of the metastable, high-temperature BCC phase. Thus, the driving force for nucleation must be low or the diffusional growth kinetics slow for the formation of the second BCC phase. The slow diffusion kinetics in HEAs have been discussed in a number of previous publications (e.g.,[2,3,27]), and have been recently verified experimentally for Co–Cr– Fe–Mn–Ni HEAs[28].",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Microstructures of annealed sheet,"Annealing at 1000 °C and 1200 °C for 2 h resulted in complete recrystallization and the formation of an equiaxed grain structure in the cold-rolled sheet. The average grain size increased with increasing temperature and decreased with an increase in plastic strain. As is typical for conventional (dilute) single-phase alloys, the temperature effect can be explained by an increase in the rate of grain growth after the completion of recrystallization, while the other trend can be explained by the increase with pre-strain in the number density of nucleation sites for new grains. Based on the measured average grain sizes in the un-deformed and the deformed-and-recrystallized conditions, it has been estimated that every original grain was replaced by either ∼64 or 257 new grains in samples annealed at 1000 °C for 2 h following cold reduction of either 65% or 84.6%, respectively. Thus, the number density of effective nucleation sites for recrystallization increased by ∼4 times with an increase in true strain from 1 to 2.3.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Microstructures of annealed sheet,"Annealing at 800 °C for 2 h resulted in a complex microstructure consisting of (a) recrystallized equiaxial grains slightly enriched with Hf and Zr (BCC1 phase), (b) non-recrystallized grains, and (c) second-phase particles slightly enriched in Nb and Ta (BCC2 phase) which had formed in non-recrystallized regions with high dislocation density, often along the deformation bands. The formation of such a structure can be explained perhaps by a small difference in the Gibbs free energies of the two BCC phases which are in equilibrium at 800 °C. The fact that recrystallized grains were free of second-phase particles suggests that such grains nucleate in areas with lower dislocation density and grow into areas with higher dislocation density before the second-phase particles can nucleate and grow in these areas.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Microstructures of annealed sheet,"The sluggish nucleation and growth of the BCC2 second-phase particles at 800 °C is likely due to the slow diffusion of Nb and Ta, inasmuch as these two elements have the highest melting points and the fact that solute mobility scales with the homologous temperature[29]. Heterogeneous nucleation of the BCC2 particles in the regions of high dislocation density is evident as these regions are sources of large numbers of point defects and increased free energy. Similar to recrystallization, the growth of the BCC2 particles removes crystal defects and effectively reduces the free energy of the non-recrystallized grains (formerly the high-temperature BCC phase). The pinning effect from these precipitates slows the migration of the boundaries of the recrystallized grains and the formation of new grains of the BCC1 phase.",[],[]
4.3,Discussion.Mechanical properties of cold rolled and annealed sheet,"Both the as-cold-rolled and the cold-rolled-and-annealed sheets of HfNbTaTiZr exhibited attractive room-temperature tensile properties (Table 3). For example, the σ0.2and σpof sheet rolled to the 84.6% reduction were 1202 and 1295 MPa, respectively, both of which are noticeablylowerthan the effective stress of 1395 MPa estimated from rolling-pressure measurements, however. Several sources of this difference may be postulated. The first is the assumption of a Mises yield function used in the conversion of the friction-corrected, (plane-strain) average pressure to effective flow stress, i.e., the term3/2= 0.866 in Equation(2). The accuracy of this assumption was estimated by calculating the Taylor factors for plane-strain compression in the sheet normal direction (equivalent to plane-strain tension in the rolling direction) and uniaxial tension in the rolling direction. For this purpose, the suite of slip systems was assumed to be the same as mentioned above, and the actual (measured) texture of the sheet rolled to a reduction of 84.6% was used. These calculations provided a Taylor factor ratio of 2.84:3.09 = 0.92, a value somewhatgreaterthan that assumed in Equation(2), viz., 0.866. Thus, the effective stresses calculated from the rolling data assuming a Mises material were on thelow, not high, side.","['fd2', 'fd2']",['tbl3']
4.3,Discussion.Mechanical properties of cold rolled and annealed sheet,"Other factors must therefore be sought to explain the difference between the rolling and uniaxial-tension flow-stress results for sheet reduced by 86.4%. One possibility is the choice of the coefficient of friction, which was assumed to be constant (μ = 0.12) during rolling. For example, an increase in the coefficient of friction to μ = 0.14 would yield the effective stress of 1250 MPa at the end of rolling. Alternatively, the change in strain path from plane-strain compression along the normal direction to uniaxial tension along the rolling direction could have given rise to a Bauschinger effect, thereby yielding unexpectedly low values of YS and UTS of the as-rolled sheet material. Last, if the material were actually rate sensitive, the ∼7 pct. difference in uniaxial-tension/rolling stress (1295 MPa vs 1395 MPa) over the three orders of magnitude difference in strain rate would require anmvalue of only ∼0.01 (10000.01= 1.07).",[],[]
4.3,Discussion.Mechanical properties of cold rolled and annealed sheet,"Annealing of the cold rolled sheet at 1000 °C for 2 h resulted in complete recrystallization and a decrease in σ0.2by 57 MPa (to 1145 MPa). Due to strain hardening and an increase in imposed total true strain to 0.097, σpreached a relatively high value of 1263 MPa, i.e., only a 32 MPa decrease relative to the as-rolled condition. Such a small difference (5%) in σ0.2between the heavily cold-rolled and recrystallized conditions is unusual. In fact, the difference in yield strength ofFCCHEAs in the cold-worked vs homogenized/recrystallized conditions has been found to be noticeably greater[30–32]. Conventional BCC alloys also generally exhibit much higher strength increases due to cold working and much more pronounced softening due to recrystallization annealing[23,24]. The present, unusually weak, degree of strain hardening for HfNbTaTiZr HEA thus requires additional research to interpret.",[],[]
4.3,Discussion.Mechanical properties of cold rolled and annealed sheet,"In the initial condition (cast and annealed at 1200 °C for 24 h), HfNbTaTiZr has been reported to have a yield strength in compression of 929 MPa[7,9], a value which is ∼23%lowerthan the tensile yield strength of the same alloy after cold-rolling and annealing at 1000 °C for 2 h. Moreover, a comparison of the flow curves in these two conditions (Fig. 19) revealed that the compression sample appeared to have a higher strain-hardening rate in addition to its lower yield strength. This difference in the behavior can be due to several sources. First, the initial processing conditions (cast vs. cold rolled) were different. Second, annealing after casting was conducted at 1200 °C for 24 h, while after cold rolling at 1000 °C for 2 h. After casting and annealing, the alloy had a large grain size (∼140 mm), and traces of dendritic structure inside the grains (i.e., some level of micro-segregation)[9]. By contrast, the grain size after cold rolling and annealing was considerably smaller (∼22 mm), and no micro-segregation was observed. Finally, cold rolling followed by annealing resulted in the development of a specific crystallographic texture.",['fig19'],[]
4.3,Discussion.Mechanical properties of cold rolled and annealed sheet,"Further inspection of the results inFig. 19revealed that a true stress of 1145 MPa (= the yield stress during tension testing) was achieved during compression of the cast-and-annealed material at a true strain of ∼0.04. When the start of the tension curve was thus shifted to this level of strain, similar strain-hardening behavior of the tension and compression samples was observed (Fig. 19). The slight difference can be explained by necking and fracture during tension testing. This analysis thus suggests that strain hardening in compression and tension of the BCC HEA is similar for microstructural conditions providing equivalent yield strength.","['fig19', 'fig19']",[]
4.3,Discussion.Mechanical properties of cold rolled and annealed sheet,"With regard to material stiffness, the measured Young's moduli of the HfNbTaTiZr alloy in the as-cold-rolled and the cold-rolled-and-annealed conditions were comparable, i.e., 93 vs 100 GPa (Table 3). By way of comparison, the Young's moduli of thepure elementscomprising the alloy lay between 68 GPa (for Zr) and 186 GPa (for Ta) (Table 5).

The ROM-predicted value for the equi-atomic alloy HfNbTaTiZr was 107.9 GPa. Although the ROM often works well for disordered solid solutions, this prediction for the HEA is somewhat higher than that measured experimentally (93–100 GPa). This difference could be due to the presence of the <110> || RD texture. However, more precise techniques for the measurement of the elastic moduli should be applied before any, possibly speculative, conclusions are drawn regarding the present program material or HEAs in general.",[],[]
5,Summary and conclusions,"A refractory high-entropy alloy, HfNbTaTiZr, was successfully cold rolled to 86.4% total thickness reduction. This represents the first successful attempt to cold roll such a material with a BCC crystal structure.",[],[]
5,Summary and conclusions,"Cold rolling resulted in extensive grain elongation, the formation of a “cellular” structure with deformation bands within the grains, and the development of crystallographic textures that depended on the rolling reduction. After 65% reduction, the textures were characterized by <111> || ND, <001> || ND, <001> || RD, and <011> || RD. An increase in strain to 86.4% reduction intensified the <011> || RD component, retained the <111>|| ND component, and weakened the <001> || ND component considerably. The 86.4% cold-rolled sheet had the true tensile stress of 1295 MPa and tensile ductility of 4.7%.",[],[]
5,Summary and conclusions,"Annealing the cold-rolled sheet at 800 °C for 2 h resulted in partial recrystallization and precipitation of second-phase particles in non-recrystallized regions. The particles were slightly enriched in Nb and Ta and had a BCC crystal structure. Concurrently, the matrix was slightly enriched in Hf and Zr and also had a BCC crystal structure. After annealing at 800 °C, the true tensile stress of the sheet increased to 1334 MPa, but the true tensile ductility decreased to 1.9%. Despite the low macroscopic ductility, the fracture behavior appeared entirely ductile.",[],[]
5,Summary and conclusions,"After annealing at 1000 °C and 1200 °C, complete recrystallization of the cold-rolled sheet occurred with the formation of large equiaxed grains. The average grain size increased with an increase in the annealing temperature. In the 86.4% cold-rolled sheet, it was ∼22 μm and 76 μm, respectively, for the two annealing temperatures. The annealed samples were essentially a single-phase BCC structure. However, they also contained a very small amount (∼1–2 vol.%) of fine second-phase precipitates. After annealing at 1000 °C, the true tensile strength and ductility were 1262 MPa and 9.7%, respectively.",[],[]
