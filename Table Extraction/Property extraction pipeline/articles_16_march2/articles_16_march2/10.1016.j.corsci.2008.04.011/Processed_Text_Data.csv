0,Abstract,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a newly developed family of multi-component alloys. The potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of the Al                        x                     CrFe1.5MnNi0.5 alloys, obtained in H2SO4 and NaCl solutions, clearly revealed that the corrosion resistance increases as the concentration of aluminium decreases. The Al                        x                     CrFe1.5MnNi0.5 alloys exhibited a wide passive region, which extended >1000mV in acidic environments. The Nyquist plots of the Al-containing alloys had two capacitive loops, which represented the electrical double layer and the adsorptive layer. SEM micrographs revealed that the general and pitting corrosion susceptibility of the HEAs increased as the amount of aluminium in the alloy increased.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Several novel multi-component alloys have been developed in recent years. These alloys comprise numerous principal elements in equimolar or near-equimolar ratios, each at 5–35at%[1,2]. Klement et al., discovered metallic glass in the early 1960s; they obtained a gold–silicon alloy by quenching the liquid alloy at a cooling rate of over one million degrees per second[3,4]. They confirmed that an amorphous phase can be obtained if the cooling rate is sufficient to suppress the nucleation and growth of crystals. Since the 1970s, intermetallic compounds of Ti–Al[5], Ni–Al[6]and Fe–Al[7]in binary systems have attracted substantial attention because they have an extremely high specific strength and thermal resistance. In 1988, the ground-breaking discovery was made that, by mixing together many metals of different atomic sizes, the melt can be frozen as a glass using the much slower cooling rate of one degree per second[8]. However, the designs of the aforementioned alloys remained limited by the fact that the matrix always contained one major element. The nanostructured HEAs were developed in an effort to break away from the traditional alloy design.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"According to Boltzmann’s hypothesis[9], the configurational entropy change per mole, ΔSconf, during the formation of a solid solution from five elements with equimolar fractions, is given by the following equation:(1)ΔSconf=-klnw=-R∑i=15xilnxi=Rln5≈1.61R,xi=15wherekis the Boltzmann constant;wis the number of mixed states, andRis the gas constant. The multiple element system has been called an HEA because its configurational entropy (ΔSconf=1.61–2.20R) exceeds that of an ordinary alloy (1.10R)[10]. The HEAs exhibit simple solid–solution structures, ease of amorphization and nanoprecipitation and promising properties such as high hardness and superior resistance to temper softening, wear and oxidation[11–14]. Among these, AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys have a hardness that increases 50% from 300 to 450Hv with increasing aluminium content from 0 to 0.5mol. The AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys exhibit significant age hardening. The maximum hardness of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy was 800Hv after an aging treatment, and without softening for up to 200h at 800°C. These alloys may therefore have great potential for use in structural parts and tools that operate at high temperatures (600–900°C)[15]. Previous studies have focused on the mechanical properties and, more importantly, on the corrosion behaviour when applications of the alloys were considered. The HEAs (AlCoCrCu0.5FeNiSi), evaluated previously, exhibited narrow passive regions in both H2SO4and NaCl solutions[16,17]. Once corrosion had begun, it proceeded faster than that of stainless steel because of the lack of a protective passive film. The purpose of this investigation was to study the effect of aluminium on the corrosion properties of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys, which have a wide passive region in H2SO4and NaCl solutions.",[],[]
2.1,Experimental.Test materials,"Elements Al, Cr, Fe, Mn and Ni in the form of granules with purities of over 99wt% were used as raw materials. Each of the alloys in this HEA family had five components in the form of AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5, consisting of 1.5mol of iron, 0.5mol of nickel, 1mol of chromium, 1mol of manganese, and either 0, 0.3 or 0.5mol aluminium. These elements were melted by the arc melting process at a current of 500 ampere in a water-cooled copper hearth. Melting and casting were conducted in a vacuum of 0.01atm. following purging with argon three times. The alloy was repeatedly melted and solidified so as to yield a completely alloyed state and to improve its chemical homogeneity. The ingots were approximately 50mm in diameter and 20mm in thickness. Table 1 presents the chemical compositions of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys in weight percentage. An alloy cylinder, used for measuring electrochemical characteristics, was obtained by cutting the bulk material using an electric arc line. Each test specimen was then cold-mounted, using an epoxy resin, to expose an area of 0.5cm2. Before electrochemical measurements were made, all specimens were mechanically polished using a series of 240–1200 SiC grit papers and cleaned in acetone and distilled water.",[],['tbl1']
2.2,Experimental.Electrochemical measurements and surface morphology,"Both electrochemical polarization (d.c.) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were performed in a typical three-electrode cell with a specimen as the working electrode. An Ag/AgCl electrode (3M KCl) withE=0.208VSHEwas used as the reference electrode and a platinum sheet with a much greater area (4cm2) than that of the specimen was used as the counter electrode. All of the potentials in this work are presented on the standard hydrogen scale (SHE). The test solution was deaerated by bubbling purified nitrogen gas before and throughout the electrochemical tests to eliminate any effect of dissolved oxygen. Potentiodynamic polarization curves and EIS were plotted after the specimen was allowed to corrode freely for 30min, the time necessary to reach a quasi-stationary value of the open circuit potential (OCP). Then, the specimen was cathodically polarized to a potential of −0.2V for 300s to reduce the possible existing surface oxides. The potentiodynamic tests were performed at a scan rate of 1mVs−1from an initial potential of −0.5V to a final potential of 1.5V versus the OCP. This scan rate was found to be convenient and sufficiently slow to prevent any distortion of the potentiodynamic polarization curves. The potential was controlled and the current was measured using a potentiostat (AUTOLAB PGSTAT30). The EIS was carried out at the OCP with a sinusoidal potential amplitude of 10mV, running from 10kHz to 10mHz, using an AUTOLAB PGSTAT30/FRA system from ECO CHEMIE. Following the polarization experiment, the specimen was cleaned using distilled water, and then dried in nitrogen. Immediately thereafter, the morphology of the corroded surface of the alloy specimen was investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL-5410).",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Potentiodynamic polarization," Fig. 1 plots the potentiodynamic polarization behaviour of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys with various aluminium contents (x=0, 0.3 and 0.5) in 0.5M H2SO4solution. The AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys have a wide passive region (ΔE>1000mV), which indicates a tendency of the alloys to passivate. Table 2 summarizes the electrochemical parameters associated with the general corrosion behaviour of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys in H2SO4solution. The corrosion potentials (Ecorr) of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys were determined to fall from −194 to −206mV as the aluminium content increased from 0.3 to 0.5mol; the corrosion current densities (icorr) of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5and Al0.5CrFe1.5MnNi0.5are 2.39×10−3and 5.08×10−3A/cm2, respectively; theicorrvalue dropped to 6.86×10−4A/cm2when aluminium was eliminated from the alloy, as in CrFe1.5MnNi0.5. Furthermore, the critical current density (icrit) increased with the aluminium content, implying that the barrier to passivation increases with the aluminium content. The passive current density (ipass) of the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy is lower than that of the Al-containing alloys. Hence, adding aluminium to the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys reduces the resistance to general corrosion in H2SO4solution when the alloys are in the passive state.",['fig1'],['tbl2']
3.1,Results and discussion.Potentiodynamic polarization,"The as-cast CrFe1.5MnNi0.5(four-component, aluminium-free) alloy is a face-centered cubic (fcc) solid–solution with an α-FeCr structure, according to the XRD patterns ( Fig. 2 )[18]. However, as the aluminium content increased, the peak intensities of the body-centered cubic (bcc) phase increased. The as-cast Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5(five-component) alloy is composed of mixed fcc/bcc phases whereas a single bcc structure was observed for the alloy containing 0.5mol aluminium. The ferritic stainless steels (such as type 430 stainless steel) are essentially iron–chromium alloys with structures mostly of the bcc α-iron type. However, the austenitic stainless steels (such as type 304 stainless steel) are ternary iron–chromium–nickel alloys, and their structures are of the fcc γ-iron type. Indeed, the austenitic stainless steels normally have greater corrosion resistance than the ferritic stainless steels[19]. This fact may suggest why the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy (fcc structure) is more resistant to corrosion than are the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5(x=0.3 and 0.5) alloys (bcc structure).",['fig2'],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Potentiodynamic polarization,"The width of the passive region (ΔE) for the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy is 1227mV. However, as the aluminium content in the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys increases from 0.3 to 0.5mol, the ΔEfalls from 1176 to 1114mV. Furthermore, a transpassive region exists for the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys in H2SO4solution. The transpassive breakdown of stainless steels occurs near the oxygen evolution potential where the chromium-rich passive film is unstable. Above the breakdown potential, water is unstable and is oxidized to oxygen gas (H2O→1/2O2+2H++2e-,E0=1.23V)[20]. The transpassive dissolution of Cr from the underlying alloy through the passive film (2Cr+7H2O→Cr2O72-+14H++12e-,E0=0.30V) is also expected in a sulfuric acid medium[21]. A wealth of information is available on the corrosion behaviour of 304 stainless steel that is exposed to H2SO4solutions[22]. Accordingly, a comparison of the corrosion behaviour of HEAs with that of the conventional ferrous alloys, such as 304 stainless steel, is of interest. Table 2 indicates that the Al-free CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy has a wider passive region than the 304 stainless steel. However, theEcorrvalues of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys are more active than that of the 304 stainless steel (−186mV), and theicorrvalues of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys also exceed that of the 304 stainless steel (7.45×10−5A/cm2) in 0.5M H2SO4.",[],['tbl2']
3.1,Results and discussion.Potentiodynamic polarization,"Although the formation of an oxide film is effective in protecting the HEA, when localized damage of this passive film occurs, pitting corrosion advances rapidly. Fig. 3 presents the potentiodynamic polarization tests of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys in 1M NaCl solution. Because pitting initiates at the pitting potential (Epit),Epitmay be used as an index of resistance to pitting corrosion: a nobler value ofEpitis associated with an increased resistance to pitting[23]. A sharp increase in the anodic current demonstrates the sustained localized breakdown of the passive film. In the present study, theEpitvalues of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5and Al0.5CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys were about equal, and they were significantly lower than for the Al-free CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy. As the aluminium content in the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys increased from 0 to 0.5mol, theEpitfell from 19 to −123mV. Therefore, the addition of aluminium to the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys reduces the resistance to pitting corrosion.",['fig3'],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Potentiodynamic polarization,"The potentiodynamic polarization curves for the Al-free and Al-containing alloys obtained in 0.5M H2SO4with various concentrations of NaCl (0–0.5M) are plotted in Fig. 4 . The potentiodynamic polarization curves of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5(x=0 and 0.3) alloys each show a passive region where∂ϕ∂logiipass≅∞in a Cl−-free solution. In all cases, the effect of adding NaCl to the H2SO4solution is to shiftEcorrandEpitto more active values. Table 3 indicates that theicorrandipassvalues increase, while ΔEchanges only slightly as the chloride content increases from 0 to 0.1M. However, at the critical chloride concentration of 0.25M,ipassincreases to values that are two orders of magnitude higher than that observed in the Cl−-free solution. The existing passive film breaks down when the applied potential reaches the pitting potential, resulting in the nucleation and formation of pits at discrete locations on the metal surface[24]. The presence of chloride in an acid solution generally increases potentiodynamic anodic currents at all potentials; however, the most notable feature here is the sharp increase in current atEpit. The current at theEpitincreases markedly as the amount of chloride in the sulfuric acid increases, regardless of whether or not aluminium is present. Moreover, as the concentration of chloride increases from 0.1 to 0.25M, ΔEfalls from 1150 to 495mV for Al-free CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy, and from 1127mV to almost no passive region for the Al-carrying Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy. Adding aluminium apparently reduces the ability to develop a passive film on the alloy surface.",['fig4'],['tbl3']
3.2,Results and discussion.Cyclic potentiodynamic polarization,"A cyclic polarization technique was used to determine whether the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys suffer from pitting corrosion in Cl−-containing acid. Cyclic polarization measurements were made at a scanning rate of 10mVs−1. The potential scan began at −0.75V and continued in the anodic direction until the potential reached 0.95V, at which value the potential scan was reversed and returned to where the polarization began. Fig. 5 plots the cyclic polarization curves of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys for (a)x=0 and (b)x=0.3, in H2SO4solution containing 0.25M of chloride. The black and gray arrows next to the forward and reverse anodic branches indicate the potential scan directions. Negative hysteresis is said to occur when the current density of the reverse scan is less than that of the forward scan whereas positive hysteresis is said to occur when the reverse scan exceeds the forward scan[25]. The negative hysteresis in the reverse scan of the cyclic polarization curve ( Fig. 5 a) indicates that the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy is not susceptible to localized corrosion, and that the passive film repairs itself. The positive hysteresis of the cyclic polarization curve ( Fig. 5 b) demonstrates that pitting of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy can be induced in a Cl−-containing solution. The area contained within a positive hysteresis loop is related to the amount of pit propagation that occurs during the cycle, according to Wilde[26]. The small area of the hysteresis loop of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy shows that the nucleated pits do not continue to grow substantially.","['fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5']",[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,"Electrochemical impedance is a powerful tool in studying corrosion and passivation processes. EIS provides more information than the other electrochemical techniques about the electrochemical processes that occur at the surface. Fig. 6 shows the effect of aluminium on the Nyquist plot of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5(x=0, 0.3 and 0.5) alloys in 0.5M H2SO4. The Nyquist plot for the Al-free CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy includes one capacitive loop from high to medium frequencies and one inductive loop at low frequencies. The capacitive loop is related to the double layer capacity, and the presence of the inductive loop reveals that the alloy surface is partly or totally active[27,28]. Moreover, for the higher aluminium-containing Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5and Al0.5CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys, a different behaviour was observed, in that the electrochemical impedance diagrams included two capacitive loops, which are typically related to the presence of an adsorption layer and charge transfer across the metal-electrolyte interface[29].",['fig6'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,"Appropriate models of the impedance were developed to fit the test data, which helped to evaluate the parameters, and thus characterize the corrosion process. Fig. 7 a and b presents the experimental and simulated Nyquist and Bode plots, respectively, of the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy. An equivalent electrical circuit was designed to best-fit the experimental results for the electrode, as displayed in Fig. 7 c. Such an impedance dispersion can be characterized using an equivalent circuitRs(Cdl[Rt(RLL)]), whereRsis the resistance of the solution;Rtis the charge transfer resistance, andCdlis the double-layer capacitance.RLis the resistance that is associated with the inductive processes, andLdenotes the pseudo-inductance[30]. Capacitance is replaced by a constant phase element (CPE) to compensate for the nonhomogeneity in the system[31].ZCPEis related to the impedance, and is given by(2)ZCPE=Y0-1(jω)-αwhere,Y0is the proportionality factor,jis the imaginary unit,ωis the angular frequency, andαis the phase shift. The CPE exponentαis a measure of the capacitance dispersion with values between 1 (ideal capacitance) and 0.7 (highly dispersed capacitance, such as at porous electrodes). Forα=0,ZCPErepresents a resistance withR=Y0−1; forα=1, it represents a capacitance withC=Y0; forα=0.5, it represents a Warburg element, and forα=−1, it represents an inductance withL=Y0-1[32].","['fig7', 'fig7']",[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,"The Nyquist plot for the aluminium-containing Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy, presented in Fig. 8 a, consists of two capacitive loops. Fig. 8 a and b displays the corresponding experimental and simulated Nyquist plot and Bode plots, respectively. The experimental impedance spectra were fitted by the equivalent circuitRs(Cdl[Rt(CadRad)]), as shown in Fig. 8 c. The second capacitive loop of the Al-containing alloy in the Nyquist plot was regarded as being caused by the formation of an adsorptive film on its surface.RadandCadrepresent the resistance and constant phase element associated with the adsorptive characteristics on the surface of the Al-containing alloy. The adsorptive complexes formed in an acid medium are produced by the dissolution of elemental aluminium in the HEA.","['fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8']",[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,Aluminium forms an adsorptive layer of Al(OH)adon the metal in a sulfuric acid solution by the following mechanism[33]:(3)Al(s)+H2O→Al(OH)ad+H++e-(4)Al(OH)ad+5H2O+H+→Al3+.6H2O+2e-,[],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,"For both alloys (CrFe1.5MnNi0.5and Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5), the agreement between the experimental and the simulated data is good. Table 4 gives the simulated values for the equivalent circuit elements. The change in the adsorptive capacitance,Y0−ad, can be used as an indicator of a change in the layer thickness,δ. The reciprocal capacitance of the adsorptive layer, 1/Y0−ad, is directly proportional to its thickness[34]. Accordingly, the expression for layer capacitance is based on the Helmholtz model[32]:(5)Y0-ad≈Cad=ε0εδS",[],['tbl4']
3.3,Results and discussion.Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy,"where,δis the thickness of the adsorptive layer,ε0is the permittivity of a vacuum (8.85×10−14F/cm),εis the dielectric constant of the medium, andSis the surface area of the electrode. Accordingly, the large capacitance thus obtained results from either a large dielectric constant of the layer that covers the surface or a high effective interface area between that surface layer and the electrolyte. Both indicate that a porous corrosion product covers the alloy[27,35]. The CPE exponentsαadobtained by fitting the EIS data are 0.72 and 0.78 for the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5and Al0.5CrFe1.5MnNi0.5, respectively. The values are consistent with a porous adsorptive film. The Al0.5CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy has lowerY0−advalues than that of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy, revealing that the thickness of the adsorptive layer increases with the amount of aluminium in the alloy.Rtis 24.0Ωcm2for the Al-free CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy, and declines to 18.7 and 21.0Ωcm2for the alloys containing 0.3 and 0.5mol of aluminium, respectively. TheRtof the 304 stainless steel (205.0Ωcm2) exceeds that of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys. Accordingly, the corrosion resistance of the 304 stainless steel is higher than that of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys. This result is consistent with the electrochemical parameters obtained from the potentiodynamic polarization curves, as presented in Table 2 .",[],['tbl2']
3.4,Results and discussion.SEM photomicrographs of corroded surfaces," Fig. 9 presents the SEM microstructure of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys after they had been anodically polarized beyond the breakdown potential (>1.25V) in 0.5M H2SO4. Fig. 9 a depicts almost no pitting, except for some general material dissolution on the surface of the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy. However, a small amount of shallow attack (∼25μm in diameter and 5–10μm in depth) occurred at the surface of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy ( Fig. 9 b). Additionally, Fig. 9 c shows an example of the localized corrosion (∼45μm in diameter and ∼50μm in depth) of the Al0.5CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy, which is larger and deeper than that of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy. Fig. 9 d displays this localized corrosion of Al0.5CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy at higher magnification, and shows a large number of holes on the surface. Aluminium tends to form a porous oxide film in H2SO4and is involved in the galvanic attack of the weaker and more porous oxide region; when the Al content of Fe–Al alloys is less than 20at%, the passivation behaviour of alloys deteriorates significantly[36]. Electron configuration theory may explain the minimum Al content that is required to fill the Fe atomic leveldand thereby modify the surface characteristics[37]. However, the Al contents of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5and Al0.5CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys are 6.98 and 11.11at%, respectively, which are significantly lower than 20at%. Accordingly, the passive films on the surfaces of these alloys are unstable, with breakdown throughout the period of the polarization test.","['fig9', 'fig9', 'fig9', 'fig9', 'fig9']",[]
3.4,Results and discussion.SEM photomicrographs of corroded surfaces," Fig. 10 presents the SEM images of the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5and the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy obtained after they had been anodically polarized beyond the breakdown potential (>1.25V) in H2SO4solution containing 0.25M chloride. Pitting is a localized attack that results in relatively rapid penetration at small discrete areas. The potentiodynamic polarization curves ( Table 3 ) demonstrate that theEpitvalue changes from 589 to 250mV, and the ΔEvalue changes from 495mV to almost zero in H2SO4solution containing 0.25M chloride, as a result of alloying the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy with 0.3mol aluminium. Hence, typical micrographs show that the pits on the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy are fewer and narrower than those formed on the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy.",['fig10'],['tbl3']
4,Conclusions,"The potentiodynamic polarization curves of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys in acidic solution exhibit active–passive corrosion behaviour, yielding an extensive passive region (ΔE>1000mV). The corrosion current density and passive current density of the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy are significantly lower than those of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5and Al0.5CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys. Therefore, the Al-free alloy is more resistant to general corrosion than that of the Al-containing alloy in acidic environments. Moreover, the alloying of aluminium in the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys impairs the pitting resistance in chloride environments, in that the pitting potentials for the Al-containing alloys are significantly lower than that for the Al-free CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy. Additionally, the negative hysteresis seen in the cyclic polarization curve confirms that the CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloy is not susceptible to localized corrosion in the Cl−-containing environments tested in this study, and that the passive film is generally believed to repair itself.",[],[]
4,Conclusions,"For the aluminium-containing Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5and Al0.5CrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys, the Nyquist plot has two capacitive loops, which are typically related to the presence of an adsorption layer and charge transfer across the metal-electrolyte interface. Finally, the dimensions of the localized and pitting corrosion increases with the aluminium content of the AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5alloys in an acid that contains chloride ions.",[],[]
