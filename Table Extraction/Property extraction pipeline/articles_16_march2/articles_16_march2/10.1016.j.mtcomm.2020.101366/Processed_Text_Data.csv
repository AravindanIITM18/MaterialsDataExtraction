0,Abstract,"High-quality aluminium-CuZrNiAlTiW high-entropy alloy (HEA) composites were fabricated by mechanical alloying and spark plasma sintering (SPS). The microstructures, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance of these composites were investigated. The as-milled HEA powders consist of a single body-centered cubic (BCC) solid solution phase. Besides the Al and BCC phases, the NiAl-rich B2 and WAl12 phases were in-situ formed in the sintered composites due to the large concentration gradient of Al between the matrix and HEA reinforcement. Compared to the SPS-ed Al bulk, the Al-HEA composites show higher microhardness and strength, caused by the dispersion strengthening of BCC phase and precipitation strengthening of B2 and WAl12 phases, as well as the serious lattice distortion. The core-shell microstructure in the composite with 10 vol.% HEA (Al10) contributes to its good compression properties with high yield strength and good plasticity. The Al20 composite exhibits a high fracture strength of 544 MPa, owing to the uniform size and distribution of BCC particles. Additionally, W and Ni could improve the stability of protective layer, and thus enhance the pitting resistance of the Al-HEA composites in seawater. The Al10 composite possesses the relatively positive corrosion potential and low corrosion rate, revealing a good general corrosion resistance.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Metal matrix composites have attracted interest in both scientific and industrial fields [1]. The combined effect of metal and other heterogeneous materials with different properties allows for achievement of properties unreachable for traditional alloys, leading to high strength [2] and service temperature capabilities [3]. Al-based composites (ABCs) are of great interest owing to their light-weight, high specific strength, remarkable mechanical properties and excellent corrosion resistance [4,5], and are widely used in aerospace, defense and automotive fields [6,7]. However, the compatibility between Al matrix and reinforcement, further performance optimization and secondary processing are major blocks in the preparation and development of ABCs. Kinds of reinforcements have been utilized as the reinforcing phases in ABCs, such as oxide [8], ceramic [9], metallic glass particles [10] and metallic compounds [11].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Conventional alloys are usually based on a single host metal. High-entropy alloys (HEAs) consist of multiple principal elements, which are an intriguing class of structural materials showing excellent strength-ductility combination, high fracture toughness, good corrosion resistance [12–15]. Owing to their excellent properties, the applications of HEAs as reinforcements have broadened the range of particle reinforced metal matrix composites [16–20]. The compressive yield strength of Cu-based composites with 20 wt.% AlCoNiCrFe HEA particles reached 330 MPa, which was increased by 220% compared with Cu matrix [16]. An Al0.6CoCrFeNi HEA particle reinforced ABC was prepared by spark plasma sintering (SPS), and its compressive fracture strength was as high as 3120 ± 80 MPa [17]. In contrast to the SiC-Al composite, the ABC with CoNiFeAl0.4Ti0.6Cr0.5HEA addition exhibited higher tensile strength, better plasticity and higher modulus (712 MPa, 0.82% and 171 GPa respectively) [18].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The previous studies reported that the SPS-ed ABCs reinforced with glassy powders containing Al element displayed better mechanical properties and corrosion resistance [21]. The bulk CuZrAlTiNi HEA fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) and SPS disclosed high microhardness of more than 1000 HV and good pitting resistance in seawater [22]. The addition of W as a refractory element led to higher hardness and strength of the HEA [23]. Moreover, the as-milled CuZrAlTiNiW HEA powders show a single BCC solid solution. It is generally accepted that BCC-type HEA has high strength [24–26], which could be used as the excellent alternative reinforcement. In this study, the CuZrAlTiNiW HEA powders with different volume fractions were added to pure Al to fabricate ABCs by MA and SPS. The detailed microstructures and mechanical properties, as well as corrosion resistance in seawater of Al-HEA composites have been investigated. The present study developed a new method to fabricate high-performance metal matrix composites with HEA and in-situ formed intermetallic phases, and created an opportunity to fabricate advanced ABCs for corrosion environments.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Pure Cu, Zr, Al, Ti, Ni and W powders (≥99.5 wt.%, ≥200 mesh) were mechanically alloyed to synthesize CuZrAlTiNiW HEA particles with equiatomic concentration. The milling experiments were handled on high-energy planetary ball mill (Fritsch P6) at a rotation speed of 300 rpm (revolutions per min) in argon atmosphere using chromium steel vial and 304 L balls. The weight ratio of milling balls to powers was set as 15:1. Besides, the milling process was interrupted every 30 min and then halted for another 10 min to avoid overheating of the vial. The as-milled CuZrAlTiNiW HEA particles were obtained after ball milling for 30 h. The pre-sintered Al/HEA powders were achieved by the homogeneous mixing with pure Al and CuZrAlTiNiW HEA powders (10, 20 and 30 vol.%, denoted as Al10, Al20, and Al30, respectively) through ball milling for 8 h using a rotation speed of 200 rpm. Consolidation of the mixing powders was performed using SPS. High strength heat-resistant graphite punch and die with an inner diameter of 10 mm were used. SPS was done at a sintering temperature of 773 K and sintering pressure of 80 MPa for 30 min. The cylindrical sintered samples were obtained with a dimension ofɸ10 × 18 mm.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The phase analysis of the as-fabricated materials was performed by X-ray diﬀ ;raction (XRD, Rigaku D8 Advance) using Cu Kαradiation (λ =0.15406 nm). The acceleration voltage and current were set to 40 kV and 30 mA, respectively. The microstructure and chemical composition were investigated by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM, QUANTA FEG 250, FEI) with energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS, OXFORD INSTRUMENTS X-Max 50 mm2), respectively. The diameters of more than 100 particles in FESEM images were estimated by using Image-Jsoftware to get the average size of precipitated particles.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Vickers hardness tester having a load carrying capacity of 200 g and a duration time of 15 s was used in the study. Each sample was conducted 15 indentations and the average values were shown in the results. The density of composites was determined using Archimedes method by electronic analytical balance. Compression test was carried at room temperature using a universal material testing machine (MTS landmark). Tests were conducted at strain rate of 1 × 10−3s-1using a cylindrical shape specimen of a dimension ofɸ10 × 15 mm. Corrosion behaviors of the sintered samples were studied using the electrochemical workstation (CHI660E) in a seawater solution. The seawater was prepared by artificial sea salt and distilled water with the mass ratio of 1:30. The working electrode was the tested samples. The counter electrode and reference electrode were a platinum sheet and an Ag-AgCl electrode, respectively. Potential-dynamic polarization curves were recorded in air at a potential sweep rate of 3 mV/s and repeated at least 3 times after the open-circuit potential was steady enough.",[],[]
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 1 displays the XRD pattern of the as-milled CuZrAlTiNiW HEA particles. Four sharp diffraction peaks are identified as a single BCC solid solution phase. It is generally accepted that BCC-type HEA has high strength, which could be used as the excellent alternative reinforcement. Therefore, the CuZrAlTiNiW reinforcement with BCC structure is expected to improve mechanical properties of ABCs.",['fig0005'],[]
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 2 presents the elemental mappings and corresponding micrograph of 30 vol.% CuZrAlTiNiW/Al mixing powders. According to the elemental mappings, Ti, Cu, Ni, Zr and W exhibit a uniform dispersion state. Therefore, CuZrAlTiNiW HEA particles evenly distribute in the Al matrix after the appropriate mixing time, which is beneficial to the subsequent sintering quality. Moreover, the average size of CuZrAlTiNiW HEA particles is about 15 μm and close to that of Al, which would contribute to the improvement of sintering density.",['fig0010'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"The XRD patterns of the SPS-ed pure Al and Al-HEA composites are shown in Fig. 3 . Besides the Al matrix and BCC phase, the composites are mainly composed of in-situ formed B2 phase (ordered BCC phase) along with WAl12intermetallic compound, and a few unknown phases. With raising the volume fractions of HEAs, the contents of B2 and WAl12phases also increase. It suggests that some principal elements from HEA can react with the Al matrix during the sintering process, which induces the separation of partial BCC phase and further causes in-situ formation of new phases.",['fig0015'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"Notably, the peak position of Al for the Al-HEA composites exhibits a different shift in the XRD patterns with different contents of HEAs. The zoom-in Al (111) peak at 2θ = 38.2–39.2° and variation of lattice constant (α) of Al phase are presented in Fig. 4 . Compared with the SPS-ed pure Al, all Al (111) peaks of composites shift to the lower 2θ angle, revealing the trend of decreasing first and then rising. The corresponding values of α of Al matrix in the SPS-ed composites are obviously larger than that of SPS-ed pure Al (3.997 Å), indicating the emergence of lattice distortion induced by HEA addition. The Al20 composite shows the largest α of 4.053 Å for Al phase, indicating the most serious lattice distortion. It suggests that the HEA addition induces a uniform reaction in the whole Al matrix, and further leads to the universal effect on the distortion of Al matrix. During the sintering process, the atom diffusion between HEA and Al matrix could lead to the existence of supersaturated point defects and vacancies in composites. Point defects in lattices could interfere with the lattice structure around vacancies, leading to large lattice distortion [27].",['fig0020'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"The relative density values of all composites calculated with respect to practical density and theoretical density reach up to 98%, as presented in Table 1 . The SPS-ed Al-HEA composites with high sintering quality were acquired. Figs. 5  and 6show the FESEM images of SPS-ed samples. It can be observed that there are no holes, cracks or flaws in the surface of the tested composites, which is ascribed to the high relative density. For Al10 ( Fig. 5 ), some irregular bright-white particles (Ⅰ) with different sizes (less than 16 μm) are inlaid in the grey regions (Ⅱ and Ⅲ) and present a dispersion distribution in the black Al matrix (Ⅴ) together. Interestingly, obvious fried egg-like core-shell structures (marked by yellow circles) are found, clearly as shown in Fig. 5(b) . The bright grey “shell” (Ⅱ) is characterized as egg white with about 4 μm in thickness, which tightly surrounds a “core” (Ⅰ) like yolk. There are dense and continuous grey transition layers (Ⅲ) outside the core-shell structures.","['fig0025', 'fig0025', 'fig0025', 'fig0030']",['tbl0005']
3,Results and discussion,"According to element mappings ( Figs. 5 (b-1) - (b-6)) and the component contents according to EDS analysis ( Table 2 ), Al, Ti, Ni, Cu, Zr and W with near-equiatomic concentration are enriched in the “core” region (Ⅰ), indicating the existence of BCC-HEA phase. Compared with the “core” region, the concentration of Al becomes more in the “shell” region, and Cu and Ni are poor (Ⅱ). According to the EDS results, the shell can be identified as (Ti,Zr,W)Al3-type phase with a cubic structure. Noticeably, not all “core” is surrounded by distinct “shell”, therefore this phase is not clearly observed in the XRD pattern. The transition layer (Ⅲ) is mainly enriched in Al (90.40 at.%) and W (7.07 at.%), which is considered as the WAl12phase surrounding the HEA phase. Some dark grey phases (Ⅵ) also recognized as the transition layer are incoherently inlaid on the outer layer of WAl12phase, where Ni and Al are enriched. Based on the EDS and XRD results, B2 phase is NiAl-rich intermetallic compound. Guo et al have proved that B2 phase was enriched with Ni-Al [28]. Moreover, the Ni35Al21.67Cr21.67Fe21.67HEA also possessed the NiAl-rich B2 phase [29]. In addition, it is evident that Al atoms exhibit a large concentration gradient from “core” (19.46 at.%), “shell” (72.12 at.%), transition layer (90.40 at.%) to matrix Al (100 at.%).",['fig0025'],['tbl0010']
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 6 shows the FESEM images of the Al20 and Al30 composites. Compared with Al10, more precipitates in the Al20 and Al30 composites are formed and disperse in the Al matrix. Moreover, the average sizes of “core” particles of Al20 and Al30 composites become obviously increased. The “core” region (Ⅰ*) contains near-equiatomic Al, Ti, Ni, Cu, Zr and W ( Fig. 6(b) ), which corresponds to the BCC-HEA phase. Meanwhile, it is lack of the obvious fried egg-like core-shell structures for the Al20 and Al30 composites. The EDS result reveals that transition region (Ⅱ*) is a WAl-rich phase, which also corresponds to stoichiometric WAl12. And the WAl12phases between HEA particles exhibit the stronger continuity trend. The outer block dark grey phase (Ⅲ*) with a discontinuous distribution embedded in WAl12phase reveals the similar element enrichment to the region Ⅳ in the Al10 composite, which is characterized as B2 phase.","['fig0030', 'fig0030']",[]
3,Results and discussion,"The phase formation of the Al-HEA composites is schematically shown in Fig. 7 . After appropriate mixing condition, the homogeneous mixture with HEA particles and Al powers can be obtained. Due to the distinct difference in Al concentration between HEA reinforcement and pure Al matrix powers, Al atoms can diffuse mutually at the Al matrix/HEA interface during the sintering process. It is generally accepted that HEAs with severe lattice distortion possess a low thermal conductivity [30]. Compared with HEAs, pure matrix Al possess a high thermal conductivity of 217.7 W/m·K, suggesting that heat in particle contacting zones can be quickly transferred by Al particles. Basing on the strong diffusion ability, more Al atoms diffuse from the matrix into the reinforcement and react with some principal elements in CuZrNiAlTiW HEA to form in-situ WAl12and NiAl-rich B2 phase around the BCC-HEA particles. These factors can promote excellent sintering quality of the tested composites and are beneficial to the high relative density. Compared with the Al20 and Al30 composites, Al10 has a larger Al concentration gradient between HEA and Al matrix. The diffusion behavior of Al atoms becomes more severe and complex, which can tend to induce the instability or separation of the BCC phase in HEA particles. Further, it promotes the formation of “egg-white” region that tightly surrounds BCC “core” with component deviation, thus forming the typical core-shell structure.",['fig0035'],[]
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 8 shows the Vickers hardness of the SPS-ed pure Al and Al-HEA composites. The CuZrAlTiNiW HEA reinforcement additions remarkably enhance the microhardness of the Al-HEA composites. Moreover, the microhardness goes up with increasing the contents of reinforcements in the Al-HEA composites. Especially, the Al30 composite has the highest average microhardness reaching up to 331 HV, which is about 10 times that of the pure Al (34 HV). According to the XRD and FEFEM results, the in-situ formed WAl12and B2 phases combined with BCC phase can hinder the dislocation movement. The dislocations become plugged, resulting in an increase in the deformation resistance, thereby enhance the microhardness of the composites.",['fig0040'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"In order to further evaluate the mechanical properties of the SPS-ed Al-HEA composites, the room-temperature compression stress-strain curves are shown in Fig. 9 and the corresponding parameters are summarized in Table 3 . all tested SPS-ed composites have the distinct advantages in the strength but have a large degree of ductility loss. The Al10 composite possesses a degree of plasticity with strain (δ) of 7.6%, and the yield strength (σ0.2) and fracture strength (σf) are 258 and 344 MPa, respectively. The good comprehensive compression properties are due to the synergy of the in-situ core-shell structures, which can effectively coordinate the deformation between the HEA and Al matrix. When the crack contacts the core-shell structure during the crack propagation, the crack tip would be passivated, thus preventing the crack propagation and maintaining the ductility. Theσfof Al20 reaches up to 544 MPa without ductility characteristic, which is nearby 5 times increase over pure Al bulk (98 MPa). However, theσfof Al30 exhibits a large reduction to 270 MPa.",['fig0045'],['tbl0015']
3,Results and discussion,"Compared with pure Al bulk, the enhanced hardness and strength of the tested composites is mainly attributed to the precipitation strengthening of in-situ B2 and WAl12phase, and dispersion strengthening of BCC-particles. It has been reported that in-situ formation of WAl12phase in ABCs obviously improved hardness and tensile strength of ABCs [31]. The NiAl-rich B2 phase also contributes to strength in the transition region. The AlCoCrFeNix(2.0 ≤x≤ 2.2) and AlCoCrxFeNi (1.8 ≤x≤ 2.0) HEAs exhibited the high tensile strength reaching up to 1120 MPa [32] and 1350 MPa [33], respectively, owing to the reason that the in-situ NiAl-rich B2 phase was barely deformed while the HEA soft phase was stretched. Furthermore, in combination with schematic illustration ( Fig. 7 ), the interfaces of Al concentration gradient among BCC phase, in-situ intermetallic compounds and matrix are formed, which are beneficial to reduce the stress concentration at the interface, further improving the stress distribution state and the bearing capacity of the composites. The serious lattice distortion of composite is also conducive to the enhanced strength.",['fig0035'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"However, among the tested composites, the Al20 composite exhibits the highest strength, which can be attributed to the following explanations. Beside their own hardening characteristic, the type, shape, size, volume fraction, and distribution of precipitations are critical for the development of the HEAs with excellent strength and sufficient ductility [34]. With increasing the HEA reinforcement contents, the volume fractions of the in-situ NiAl-rich B2, WAl12and BCC phases become enhanced in composites. Because the in-situ B2 phase is mainly embedded in the transition layer of WAl12phase and they show the similar contrast, it is difficult to identify their size and shape except for the thickness of WAl12phase. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the size and distribution of the “core” BCC-particles in the tested composites. The distributions of statistical BCC-particle diameter of Al-HEA composites are revealed in Fig. 10 . In spite of smaller average size of BCC-particle in Al10 (about 6.0 μm), its precipitation content is obviously insufficient. The average BCC-particle sizes of Al20 and Al30 are just around 10 μm. However, the Al20 composite possesses the more well-distributed BCC-particle size, and most particle (49%) sizes are around 9 μm. Combined with the morphologies of Al10 and Al30, it can be clearly observed that the distribution of BCC-particles in the Al20 matrix is more uniform, as shown in Fig. 5(a)  and Figs. 6 ((a) and (c)). Lu et al. have reported that the content of precipitates in HEA is not high enough, and the distribution is not uniform, all could further prevent the improvement of mechanical properties [35]. The interaction of the dispersed homogeneous hard BCC-particles with the dislocation hinders the movement of the dislocation, thus improving the plastic deformation resistance of the alloy. Therefore, based on the uniformity of size and distribution of BCC-particles, it is reasonable that the Al20 composite shows strong strength and higher hardness. However, it is no denying that the Al20 composite lacks ductility owing the absence of a typical core-shell structure.","['fig0050', 'fig0025', 'fig0030']",[]
3,Results and discussion,"Additionally, in contrast to Al30, the thickness of transition layer in Al20 is less than 2 μm. The interface between HEA and Al matrix of Al20 is smooth and tightly bonds with BCC particle. The thicker transition layers in Al30 have a continuous and intensive distribution in the Al matrix. Previous studies have shown that the thick transition layer is harmful to theσ0.2andσfof the composite, ascribing to that the intrinsic crack source could be easily formed [36]. In a thick transition layer, nucleation cracks may be able to diffuse unimpeded in the brittle region or along the reaction layer.",[],[]
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 11 shows the typical potentiodynamic polarization curves for the SPS-ed pure Al and Al-HEA composites in seawater solution. The parameters of corrosion current density (icorr), general corrosion rates (rcorr), corrosion potential (Ecorr), pitting potential (Epit), and passive region (ΔE=Epit-Ecorr) are summarized in Table 4 . Al10 exhibits the lowesticorrof 0.86×10−5A/mm2and relatively positiveEcorrof -1.04 V, demonstrating that appropriate HEA addition is beneficial to enhance the general corrosion resistance of composites. Further identifying the corrosion resistance, thercorris calculated from Eq.1.(1)rcorr=0.00327EW×icorrnDWhereEWis the equivalent weight of the composite, 0.00327 is a constant, andDis the density of composite. TheEWandDused for Al10, Al20 and Al30 are 9.55, 9.15, 8.79 and 3.25, 3.79, 4.34 g/cm3, respectively. As can be seen in Table 4 , the Al10 composite exhibits the lowestrcorramong the SPS-ed pure Al and other Al-HEA composites, further demonstrating the enhanced general corrosion resistance.",['fig0055'],"['tbl0020', 'tbl0020']"
3,Results and discussion,"In addition, all composites show the obvious passivation region compared with SPS-ed pure Al specimen, possessing the good pitting resistance in seawater. The Al30 composite bears the largest ΔEvalue (0.89 ± 0.05 V), indicating a good pitting resistance. In this work, it can be inferred that the translation layer is enriched in W and Ni. The W element can improve the stability of the protective layer as follows: W+3H2O = WO3+6H++6e−. Moreover, W6+ions are easy to form (WO4)2−anions as the following: WO3+ H2O = (WO4)2−+ 2H++ 6e−. In addition, Ni element also possesses a good corrosion resistance in many environments. Ni element can easily participate in the anodic passivation, which is beneficial to form protective oxide film composed of Ni(OH)2as well as denser NiOOH film at higher electrode potential [37] as the following: Ni(OH)2= NiOOH+H++e−. Moreover, the high sintering quality and relative density are also beneficial to the enhancement of comprehensive corrosion resistance of composite in seawater solution with CuZrNiAlTiW HEA reinforcements.",[],[]
4,Conclusions,"The CuZrNiAlTiW HEA reinforcement with single BCC solid solution phase is produced by MA method. The Al-HEA composites possessing high relative density, high microhardness as well as highσf, have been fabricated by SPS technique. The following conclusions can be drawn as follows:",[],[]
4,Conclusions,"1. The as-milled product of HEA is a single BCC solid solution phase. Besides matrix Al and BCC phases, the large concentration gradient between Al matrix and HEA particles induces the formation of in-situ NiAl-rich B2 and WAl12phases as the translation layer around BCC phase. Moreover, the formation of core-shell structure for the Al10 composite is an interesting phenomenon occurring during the SPS process, which can effectively coordinate the deformation between the HEA and Al matrix.",[],[]
4,Conclusions,"2. Compared to the SPS-ed pure Al bulk, the Al-HEA composites all possess higher microhardness andσf. The average microhardness of Al30 composite reaches up to 331 HV, which is about 10 times that of the pure Al (34 HV). The high strength of composites is mainly put down to the precipitation strengthening of in-situ B2 and WAl12phases, dispersion strengthening of BCC-particles, interfaces of Al concentration gradient among different sintered phases, as well as the large lattice distortion. The core-shell structure in the Al10 composite can effectively promote good comprehensive compression properties with higherσ0.2of 258 MPa andδof 7.23%. The Al20 composite exhibits the excellent performance inσfas high as 544 MPa, which is nearby 5 times increase over pure Al bulk (98 MPa). The more precipitation content, uniformity of size and distribution of BCC-particles in Al matrix are beneficial to further enhance its strength.",[],[]
4,Conclusions,"3. The pitting resistance of the SPS-ed Al-HEA composites is enhanced in seawater solution compared with pure Al. The Al30 composite bears the largest ΔEvalue (0.89 V), demonstrating the best pitting resistance. Moreover, the Al10 composite possesses the relatively positiveEcorr(-1.04 V) and lowrcorr(0.827 mm/yr), revealing a good general corrosion resistance. Besides the high sintering quality and relative density, it is mainly attributed to that the W and Ni in the transition layer can improve the stability of the protective layer.",[],[]
