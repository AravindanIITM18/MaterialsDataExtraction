The AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy consists of two body-centered cubic (bcc) phases with very close lattice parameters, a                     1                     =326.8pm and a                     2                     =332.4pm. One phase was enriched with Mo, Nb and Ta and another phase was enriched with Al and Zr. The phases formed nano-lamellae modulated structure inside equiaxed grains. The alloy had a density of ρ                     =7.40gcm−3 and Vickers hardness H                     v                     =5.8GPa. Its yield strength was 2000MPa at 298K and 745MPa at 1273K. The Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr had a single-phase bcc structure, with the lattice parameter a                     =336.7pm.

The properties of these Al-containing alloys were compared with the properties of the parent CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr and HfNbTaTiZr alloys and the beneficial effects from the Al additions on the microstructure and properties were outlined. A thermodynamic calculation of the solidification and equilibrium phase diagrams was conducted for these alloys and the calculated results were compared with the experimental data.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Multi-principal-element alloys, also known as high-entropy alloys (HEAs) because of their high entropy of mixing of alloying elements, have recently come to the attention of the scientific community due to some interesting and unexpected microstructures and properties[1–3]. The metallurgical strategy is to stabilize the disordered phase relative to impinging ordered intermetallics by maximizing the configurational entropy. One appealing aspect of this approach is that the reduction of the Gibbs free energy, by the entropy of formation, increases with an increase in temperature. Such an approach could be very useful in developing new high-temperature structural alloys, in an alloy composition space that has not been previously explored. While the HEA approach has produced some stable solid solution body-centered-cubic (bcc) and face-centered-cubic (fcc) alloys[1,4–9], recent studies have shown that intermetallic phases can form in HEAs. This often is associated with alloying with elements with large differences in atomic radius and large negative enthalpies of mixing[4,10,11].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Several high-entropy refractory alloys with promising combinations of room temperature and elevated temperature mechanical properties and oxidation resistance have recently been reported. These are MoNbTaW, MoNbTaVW[6,7], HfNbTaTiZr[8,9], CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr[12,13]and CrxNbTiVyZr[14,15]. The high entropy of mixing and similar atomic radii (e.g. ∼146pm) of the alloying elements resulted in the formation of disordered bcc crystal structures in the alloys without Cr. However, the alloys with Cr, the atomic radius (rCr=128pm) of which is much smaller than the atomic radii of other elements, additionally contained a cubic Laves phase, resulting in a considerable decrease in ductility at temperatures below 800°C[12,14,15].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In the present work, the compositions of two earlier reported refractory alloys, HfNbTaTiZr and CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr, have been modified to produce the Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr and AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloys. Here we study the effect of alloying with Al on the microstructure, composition and mechanical properties of these new refractory HEAs. Aluminum forms a number of binary and ternary intermetallic phases with bcc refractory elements. At the same time, the atomic radius of Al (rAl=143pm) is very similar to the atomic radii of the refractory elements (〈r〉=146pm), excluding Cr (rCr=128pm), which may affect the formation energy of the intermetallic phases in the HEAs. Furthermore, it has been well documented that additions of Al stabilize the bcc crystal structure in the AlxCoCrCuFeNi[1]and AlxCoCrFeMnNi[16]HEAs and gradually transform their crystal structure from fcc to bcc. It is also expected that alloying with Al will considerably reduce the density of the refractory HEAs.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr and Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr HEAs were prepared by vacuum arc melting of nominal mixtures of the corresponding elements. Titanium, zirconium and hafnium were in the form of 3.2mm diameter slugs with purities of 99.98%, 99.95% and 99.9%, respectively. Niobium and tantalum were in the form of 1.0 and 2.0mm wires, and their purities were 99.95% and 99.9%, respectively. Molybdenum was in the form of 1mm thick sheet with a purity of 99.99%. Aluminum was in the form of 50–100mm3buttons with a purity of 99.999%. Arc melting was conducted on a water-cooled copper plate. High-purity molten titanium was used as a getter for residual oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen. To achieve a homogeneous distribution of elements in the alloys, each alloy was re-melted five times, was flipped for each melt, and was in a liquid state for ∼5min during each melting event. The prepared specimens were ∼12mm high, 30mm wide and 100mm long and had shiny surfaces, indicating minimal oxidation during vacuum arc melting. The actual alloy compositions, determined with inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy, are given in Table 1 . The AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy was hot isostatically pressed (HIPed) at 1673K and 207MPa for 2h and then annealed at 1673K for 24h in continuously flowing high-purity argon. The Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloy was HIPed at 1473K and 207MPa for 2h and then annealed at 1473K for 24h in continuously flowing high-purity argon. During HIP and annealing, the samples were covered with Ta foil to minimize oxidation. The cooling rate after annealing in both cases was 10Kmin−1. The crystal structure was identified with the use of an X-ray diffractometer, Cu Kα radiation and a 2Θscattering range of 10–140°. The experimental error in the measurements of the lattice parameters was ±0.5pm.",[],['t0005']
2,Experimental procedures,"Alloy densities were measured with an AccuPyc 1330 V1.03 helium pycnometer. Vickers microhardness was measured on polished cross-section surfaces using a 136° Vickers diamond pyramid under 500g load applied for 20s. The microstructure was analyzed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) Quanta 600F (FEI, North America NanoPort, Hillsboro, Oregon, USA) equipped with backscatter electron (BSE), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction detectors. The experimental error in the measurements of the chemical composition was ±0.3at.%. The average grain/particle size and the volume fractions of the phases were determined in accordance with ASTM E112 and ASTM E562 standards, using the image analysis software Fovea Pro 4.0 by Reindeer Graphics, Inc.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Compression tests of rectangular specimens with the dimensions of ∼4.7mm×4.7mm×7.7mm were conducted at 298K, 873K, 1073K, 1273K and 1473K in a computer-controlled Instron (Instron, Norwood, MA) mechanical testing machine outfitted with a Brew vacuum furnace and silicon carbide dies. Prior to each test, the furnace chamber was evacuated to ∼10−4Nm−2. The test specimen was then heated to the test temperature at a heating rate of ∼20Kmin−1, soaked at the test temperature for 15min under 5N controlled load and then compressed to a 50% height reduction or to fracture, whichever happened first. A constant ramp speed that corresponded to an initial strain rate of 10−3s−1was used. Room temperature tests were conducted at the same loading conditions but in air. The deformation of all specimens was video-recorded and image correlation software Vic-Gauge (Correlated Solutions, Inc.) was used to measure strains.",[],[]
3.1,"Results.Crystal structure, density and microhardness","X-ray diffraction patterns of the annealed cast alloys are shown in Fig. 1 . Two phases, both with the bcc crystal structures, are identified in the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy ( Fig. 1 a). The lattice parameters of these phases area1=326.8pm anda2=332.4pm, respectively ( Table 2 ). The Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloy has a single-phase bcc crystal structure, with the lattice parametera=336.7pm ( Fig. 1 b, Table 2 ). No super-lattice peaks, as an evidence of crystal ordering, are observed. The density,ρ, and Vickers microhardness,Hv, values of the produced refractory alloys are given in Table 3 . For the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy,ρ=7.40gcm−3andHv=5.8GPa, while for the Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloy,ρ=9.05gcm−3andHv=4.9GPa.","['f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005']","['t0010', 't0010', 't0015']"

Indeed, the replacement of Cr with Al eliminates the brittle Laves phase, increases microhardness from 5.3GPa to 5.8GPa and reduces the density from 8.23gcm−3to 7.40gcm−3. Similarly, partial substitution of Hf with Al considerably increases microhardness (from 3.8 to 4.9GPa) and decreases the alloy density (from 9.94 to 9.05gcm−3), although the Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloy retains the single-phase bcc structure.",[],"['t0010', 't0015']"
3.2,Results.Compression properties,"The engineering stress vs. engineering strain curves of the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr and Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloy samples tested at different temperatures are shown in Fig. 2 a and b, respectively. The compression properties of these alloys, such as yield strength,σ0.2, maximum strength,σp, elastic modulus,E, and fracture strain,δ, are given inTables 4 and 5, respectively. Both alloys show very high strength at room temperature (RT). The AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy hasσ0.2=2000MPa andσp=2368MPa, while the Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloy hasσ0.2=1841MPa andσp=2269MPa. The RT compression ductility of both alloys is the same,δ=10%, while the elastic modulus of the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr (E=178.6GPa) is considerably higher than that of the Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloy (E=78.1GPa). With an increase in the temperature, the strengths and elastic modulus decrease, while the compression ductility increases (Tables 4 and 5). The strength decrease occurs more rapidly in the Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr than in AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr. For example, atT=1273K and 1473K, the yield strength of the Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloy isσ0.2=745MPa and 250MPa, while of the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy isσ0.2=298MPa and 89MPa, respectively.

3.2,Results.Compression properties," Fig. 3 compares the yield strength of the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr and Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloys with, respectively, the CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr and HfNbTaTiZr alloys. The replacement of Cr with Al increasesσ0.2at all studied temperatures (compare AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr and CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr). The effect is especially important at high temperatures. For example, atT=1273K and 1473K, the CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy hasσ0.2=546MPa and 170MPa, while the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy hasσ0.2=745MPa and 255MPa, respectively, i.e. 36–50% strength increase. After partial replacement of Hf with Al, the RT yield strength almost doubles (compare Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr and HfNbTaTiZr). However, the strength difference decreases with an increase in temperature, and no effect from the Al addition is seen for this alloy pair atT=1273K and 1473K (see Fig. 3 ).","['f0015', 'f0015']",[]
3.3.1,Results.Microstructure.Annealed condition,"Representative SEM backscatter images of the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy after annealing at 1673K for 24h and slow cooling are shown in Fig. 4 . The alloy consists of a polycrystalline matrix with average grain size of 75±5μm and second-phase particles (darker material in Fig. 4 a) precipitated at grain boundaries. The volume fraction of these second-phase particles isvf=11.5±1.5%. EDS analysis ( Table 6 ) shows that the average composition of the matrix grains (identified as #1 in Fig. 4 a and Table 6 ) is very close to the overall composition of the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy (compareTables 6 and 1), while the dark particles (identified as #2) are enriched with Al and Zr. Higher magnification images reveal the presence of very fine, basket-like lamellar structure inside the grains ( Fig. 4 b). The average lamellar spacing inside the grains is estimated to be 70±5nm. The lamellae coarsen at grain boundaries and reveal the presence of two phases with distinct Z contrasts. Namely, the BSE contrast of one phase is bright, which is an indication that this phase contains larger amounts of heavier elements, and another phase is dark, which is an indication that this phase mainly consists of lighter elements. The EDS analysis shows that the lamellae of the bright phase (similar to those identified as #3 in Fig. 4 b) are enriched with Mo, Nb and Ta (relative to the average alloy composition), while the lamellae of the dark phase (identified as #4) are enriched with Al and Zr ( Table 6 ). These EDS data should, however, be interpreted as an estimate of the differences in composition of these two phases, because X-ray emission volume, at the electron beam size of 3–4nm and accelerating voltage of 15kV, is estimated to be above ∼100nm in diameter in this alloy[17,18], and the adjacent lamellae of another phase contribute to the intensity of the collected EDS peaks. Therefore, the measured compositions of the lamellae of the dark and bright phases are somewhat between the actual compositions of these phases. Taking into account that the X-ray diffraction shows the presence of only two phases, it is reasonable to suggest that the large dark particles at grain boundaries and nanometer-sized dark lamellae inside the grains are of the same phase and thus have the same composition. Because the two phases (bright and dark on the BSE images) have the same bcc crystal structure with very close lattice parameters (see Table 2 ) we were unable to identify which phase is bcc1 and which is bcc2.","['f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020']","['t0030', 't0030', 't0030', 't0010', 't0030', 't0005']"
3.3.1,Results.Microstructure.Annealed condition,"After annealing at 1473K for 24h, the single-phase Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloy has an equiaxed grain structure ( Fig. 5 a). The average grain size is 140±10μm. Slight etching reveals the presence of finer subgrain structure inside the grains ( Fig. 5 b).

3.3.2,Results.Microstructure.Microstructure after compression deformation at 1273K,"The microstructure of the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy after 50% compression deformation atT=1273K is shown in Fig. 6 . The alloy constituents present in the annealed condition are retained after the deformation. The matrix grains are slightly elongated in the directions of local plastic flow, which are inclined by ∼90–60° to the compression direction, and dark second-phase particles remain present at grain boundaries ( Fig. 6 a). The volume fraction of these particles isvf=9.0±1.0%, i.e. slightly smaller than before the deformation. A characteristic relief forms inside the grains ( Fig. 6 b). This relief is likely a result of interaction of the local material flow with the interface boundaries between two nano-lamellar phases. After the deformation, the lamellar structure inside the matrix grains and at grain boundaries becomes coarser ( Fig. 6 b and c). Additionally, submicron-sized regions (spots), in which the nano-lamellar structure disappears, form inside many grains ( Fig. 6 d). The chemical composition of the alloy constituents is given in Table 7 . After deformation, the average composition of grains (#1 in Fig. 6 a and Table 7 ) does not change and only minor changes in the composition of the dark-color large second-phase particles (#2 in Fig. 6 a and Table 7 ) are detected. At the same time, the coarsened nano-lamellae of the bright phase (#3 in Fig. 6 b and6c and in Table 7 ) become more enriched with Mo and Nb and slightly depleted of Al and Zr (in comparison with the annealed state). Coarsened nano-lamellae of the dark phase (#4 in Fig. 6 and Table 7 ) are more enriched with Al and Zr and depleted of other elements (compareTables 6 and 7) and their composition becomes closer to the composition of the dark-color large second-phase particles (#2) located at grain boundaries. This observation seems to support our earlier suggestion that the large dark particles at grain boundaries and nanometer-sized dark lamellae inside the grains are the same phase and thus have the same composition. The composition of newly formed gray spots is very close to the average composition of grains and differs only by a slightly smaller concentration of Mo and a higher concentration of Ti.","['f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030']","['t0035', 't0035', 't0035', 't0035', 't0035', 't0030', 't0035']"

Grains become elongated in the directions of plastic flow ( Fig. 7 a) and deformation bands crossing some grain boundaries can be observed ( Fig. 7 b). Characteristic bands and spots with different contrasts are present inside the deformed grains. These distinctive contrasts inside the grains are likely caused by different electron channeling conditions and indicate the presence of a subgrain structure and internal stresses, which lead to slight misorientations of the regions inside the deformed grains[19]. Fine recrystallized grains, the average size of which is ∼1.3μm, are formed at grain boundaries of deformed grains ( Fig. 7 c and d). The chemical compositions of the recrystallized and non-recrystallized grains are the same as the average composition of the alloy ( Table 1 ). A higher magnification image ( Fig. 7 d) shows the presence of nano-precipitates at the boundaries of the recrystallized grains. Their small size does not allow chemical analysis.","['f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035']",['t0005']

The diffraction peaks from the deformed AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy sample become sharper and the presence of two bcc phases is clearly seen ( Fig. 8 a). The lattice parameter of the bcc1 phase slightly decreases froma1=326.8pm in the annealed condition toa1=325.9pm after deformation, while the lattice parameter of the bcc2 phase does not change and isa2=332.2pm. These results taken with the above described changes in the compositions of the bright and dark particles suggest that the bright-color particles are the bcc1 phase while the dark-color particles are the bcc2 phase. However, additional transmission electron microscopy studies are required to verify this suggestion. After the compression deformation at 1273K, the Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr alloy retains the single-phase bcc structure ( Fig. 8 b).

Solidification of the CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy starts at 2877K and ends at 1610K.

4.1,Discussion.Effect of Al additions on microstructure and properties,"The results of this work demonstrate that the addition of Al to refractory HEAs have several beneficial effects. First, being much lighter than any of the refractory elements, Al considerably reduces the alloy density. For example, complete substitution of Cr with Al in CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr reduces the density by 10.1%; partial (40%) substitution of Hf with Al in HfNbTaTiZr reduces the alloy density by 9.0%. Second, the addition of Al results in an increase in the RT hardness and strength of refractory HEAs. For example, RT hardness and yield strength of AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr are 9.4% and 12.7% higher than of CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr. RT hardness and yield strength of Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr are 28.9% and 84.8% higher than the respective properties of HfNbTaTiZr.",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Al additions on microstructure and properties,"A similar strengthening effect from the Al addition was earlier reported in the Co–Cr–Cu–Fe–Ni HEA system and was related to the transformation of a softer fcc phase to stronger bcc phase with an increase in the concentration of Al[1,24,25]. In our case, however, the Al-induced strengthening in the AlXHf1–XNbTaTiZr system occurs without any evidence of phase transformation and the alloys withX=0 andX=0.4 have similar single phase bcc crystal structures. Moreover, the average grain size in these alloys is also the same[8]. Therefore, the Al-induced strengthening mechanism in the AlXHf1–XNbTaTiZr alloy system is not related to the phase changes. One may suggest that it can be caused by the formation of stronger interatomic bonds, as Al has strong bonding to each of the alloying elements (see below). The rapid decrease in the difference between the strengths of the Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr and HfNbTaTiZr alloys with an increase in temperature can then be explained by rapid weakening of the Al–TM bonds. The first-principles calculations are, however, required to verify the proposed scenario.",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Al additions on microstructure and properties,"At the same time, the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy consists of a very fine nano-scale mixture of two (likely coherent) phases, bcc1 and bcc2, at near equal volume fractions, while the parent CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy consists of three relatively coarse-grained phases, bcc1, bcc2 and Laves, at the volume fractions of 67%, 16% and 17%, respectively[12]. Therefore, the Al-induced strengthening in this alloy system can be due to both stronger interatomic bonds and much more developed interface boundaries between the phases, which impede deformation flow. Due to high thermal stability of the two-phase nanostructure, the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy retains its high strength at temperatures up to 1473K, and the difference in the strengths of this alloy and the parent Cr-containing alloy increases with an increase in temperature.",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Al additions on microstructure and properties,"Additional advantage from the replacement of Cr with Al in the refractory HEAs is suppression or complete elimination of the formation of a brittle, topologically close-packed Laves phase. The formation of such a Laves phase is favored by the presence of two types of atoms with the atom size ratio close to3/2≈1.225[26]. Among the refractory elements, Cr has the smallest atomic radius and forms binary Laves phases with Nb, Ta, Ti and Zr[27]at the atomic radius ratios of 1.14, 1.14, 1.15 and 1.25, respectively (see Table 12 ). At the same time, the atomic radius of Al is very close to the atomic radii of other alloying elements. The small atomic size difference between the alloying elements has recently been shown to be one of the necessary criteria favoring the formation of disordered solid solutions and discouraging the formation of intermetallic phases in HEAs[10,11,28,29]. On the other hand, Al has a different crystal structure and forms a number of binary intermetallic phases with refractory elements[27]. Therefore, it is worth understanding why the refractory HEAs containing Al do not form intermetallic phases.",[],['t0060']
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Al additions on microstructure and properties,"Binary intermetallic phases, which are present in the binary alloy systems of the selected alloying elements, are listed in Table 13 . Their enthalpies of mixing and the temperature ranges of stability are also shown there. It is seen from this table that Al can form a number of binary intermetallic phases with Hf, Mo, Nb, Ta, Ti and Zr. Other binary intermetallic phases that can form between the selected alloying elements are five Laves phases, i.e. Mo2Zr, Cr2Nb, Cr2Ta, Cr2Ti and Cr2Zr. The AlZr intermetallic phase has the largest enthalpy of formation, ΔHmix=−43.7kJmol−1, followed by Al3Zr2(−42.6kJmol−1) and Al2Zr3(−41.4kJmol−1). The large negative values mean strong bonding between the two elements, and heat is evolved when forming the compound. The enthalpies of formation of other Al–Zr intermetallics and those of Al–Hf are between −40 and −30kJmol−1and Al–Ti intermetallics are between −30 and −20kJmol−1(see Table 13 ). From Table 13 , it is found that strong binary compounds form in the Al–Zr and Al–Hf binary systems, followed by those in the Al–Ti system, then in the Al–Nb binary. In comparison, Cr2Zr has the strongest bond (with an enthalpy of formation of −11.3kJmol−1) among all the binary Laves phases, but it is significantly weaker than the bonds in all the Al–Zr, Al–Hf, Al–Ti, Al–Ta and Al–Nb binary intermetallic phases. Because more negative enthalpy of formation between two elements generally indicates a higher tendency to form intermetallic phases, a number of Al-containing intermetallics should be expected in the Al-containing refractory HEAs. Surprisingly, the experimental results did not show the formation of intermetallic phases in the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr and Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr HEAs. The thermodynamic analysis also does not predict intermetallic phases in the Al0.4Hf0.6NbTaTiZr HEA atT⩾900K, in the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr HEA atT⩾1131K and in the CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr HEA atT⩾1542K (see Table 9 ). The simulation, however, calculates two intermetallic phases, Ti3Al and Al2Zr3, in AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr atT<1131K and 1068K, respectively, and a Laves Cr2Zr phase in CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr. It is likely that although the very negative mixing enthalpies favor the formation of intermetallic phases, other parameters of the HEAs, such as mixing entropy, atomic size difference and electronegativity difference of the alloying elements, may favor the formation of solid solution phases.",[],"['t0065', 't0065', 't0065', 't0045']"
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Al additions on microstructure and properties,"Zhang et al. and Yang and Zhang[11,30]have recently defined two parameters,δrandΩ, to predict the composition range of solid solution phase formation in HEAs.

The parameterΩtakes into account the combined effects of the mixing entropy,ΔSmix=-R∑cilnci, mixing enthalpy,ΔHmix=∑4ωijcicj, and effective melting temperature,Tm=∑ciTmi, of a HEA and is defined as:(2)Ω=TmΔSmix|ΔHmix|Hereωijis a concentration-dependent interaction parameter between elementsiandjin a sub-regular solid solution model[31]andTmiis the melting temperature of elementi. Analyzing a number of non-refractory HEAs, Yang and Zhang have found that the formation of intermetallic phases in a HEA during solidification is restricted ifΩ>1.1 andδr<6.6%[30].",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Al additions on microstructure and properties,"Using the atomic radii and melting temperatures of the elements given in Table 12 , as well asωijvalues from Ref.[31], the parameters ΔHmix, ΔSmix,Ωandδrhave been calculated for the four refractory HEAs, and their values are given in Table 14 . ΔHmixhas the maximum value of 2.7kJmol−1for HfNbTaTiZr and the minimum value of −17.0kJmol−1for AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr. The CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr HEA, which contains 17% of the Laves phase, has ΔHmix=−5.2kJmol−1. It can be seen that there is no direct correlation between the ΔHmixvalues and the formation of the intermetallic phase. The Al- and Cr-containing alloys have the same values of ΔSmix=14.5Jmol−1K−1and HfNbTaTiZr has ΔSmix=13.4Jmol−1K−1. Thus, there is no correlation between ΔSmixand the formation of intermetallic phases in these alloys either. At the same time, the combined parameterΩvaries fromΩ=1.7 for AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr toΩ=12.7 for HfNbTaTiZr, whileδris equal to 4.3% for the Hf-containing alloys, 4.5% for AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr and 7.2% for CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr. TheΩcriterion (Ω>1.1) predicts that these four refractory alloys should form solid solution phases. On the other hand, theδrcriterion (δr>6.6%) confirms the formation of an intermetallic phase in the Cr-containing alloy. One can therefore conclude that the formation of intermetallic phases in the refractory HEAs seems to be more sensitive to the atomic size difference than to the values of the enthalpy of mixing of the alloying elements.",[],"['t0060', 't0070']"
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Al additions on microstructure and properties," Table 14 also shows the values of the electronegativity difference parameter,δχ, and the valence electron concentration (V) difference parameter,δv, for the studied HEAs.

TheχiandVivalues are given in Table 12 . In accordance with Hume-Rothery rules for binary substitutional solid solutions[32], the solvent and solute should have the same valency and similar electronegativity, in addition to small atomic size difference. Therefore, it is interesting to see if these rules also work for complex HEAs. The results seem to show no direct correlation betweenδχand the formation of intermetallic phases. Both the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr and CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloys have the same high value ofδχ=13.8%, in spite of the fact that the first alloy does not form an intermetallic phase. Two Hf-containing alloys have noticeably smallerδχ=7.8–8.1%. A similar conclusion has been drawn earlier for non-refractory HEAs[30]. We also did not find any reasonable correlation betweenδVand the formation of intermetallic phases (see Table 14 ). The smallestδVvalue of 11.1% has the single bcc phase HfNbTaTiZr and the highestδVvalue of 20.9% has the two-phase AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy.

4.2.1,Discussion.Comparison of thermodynamic calculations with experimental data.AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr,"Although the thermodynamic analysis predicts two phases, bcc1 and Al2Zr3, after NE solidification, and three phases, bcc1, Ti3Al and Al2Zr3, in the equilibrium condition, the experimental results show the presence of two bcc phases in the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy. There is no experimental evidence for the presence of a hexagonal (Ti3Al) and/or tetragonal (Al2Zr3) phases in this alloy at RT. Moreover, evolution of the microstructure during compression deformation at 1273K suggests that the two bcc phases are also present at 1273K, while the thermodynamic analysis suggests the existence of a single bcc phase atT>1131K. At the same time, the binary Ti–Mo, Nb–Zr and Ta–Zr phase diagrams contain a wide phase separation range where the high-temperature bcc phase decomposes into two bcc phases, one of which is rich with Ti and/or Zr and another is rich with Mo, Nb, and/or Ta. For example, in the Ta–Zr system, two bcc phases are present at 1073K⩽T⩽2053K[33]. It is likely that similar phase separation also occurs in the multicomponent AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy, with one bcc phase enriched with Mo, Nb and Ta and another bcc phase enriched with Zr. The formation of the low-temperature Ti3Al and Al2Zr3phases is probably restricted by slow diffusion of the alloying elements in HEAs[33].",[],[]

The X-ray and microstructural analysis revealed the presence of only one bcc phase in this alloy, both in annealed and in hot deformed conditions. The absence of the low temperature phases can be due to sluggish diffusion of the alloying elements or to the limitation of the current PanTi thermodynamic database.",[],[]

One reason for this is that the alloys, even after 24h annealing at 1673 or 1473K, were still in NE conditions because of sluggish diffusion. Another explanation is that the currently available thermodynamic database is not sufficient to correctly predict phase compositions of these multi-principal-element alloys. Indeed, this database was developed by CompuTherm, LLC for Ti-rich alloys via extrapolation of the interaction parameters from the lower order constituent binary and (some) ternary systems to higher order interactions[35]. Since it is focused at the Ti-rich corner, many phases away from the Ti-rich corner are not well modeled, or even not included in the database. This database, therefore, needs further development in order to be used in the middle of the composition space for the design of HEAs.",[],[]
