1,Introduction,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs), a newly developed alloy system proposed by Yeh and Cantor[1–3], have attracted considerable attentions in recent years. HEAs, which are defined as alloys containing at least five principal elements with atomic concentration between 5% and 35%, have broken the traditional alloy design concept based on one or two principal components[1–5]. It was proved that HEAs usually formed simple solid-solutions rather than many complex phases under proper composition design[6–10]. These alloys show great potentials for engineering applications due to their multiple excellent properties, such as high strength, good ductility and outstanding resistances to wear, oxidation and corrosion et al[9–13].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Elemental composition is a critical factor in alloy design, which will definitely affect the alloying behaviors and phase composition of HEAs[14]. It was proved in the synthesis of HEAs that Cu, Ni, Mn and Cr elements favour the generation of FCC solid-solution phases, while Al, Cr, W, V and Ti elements promote the formation of BCC phases[6,8–10]. Addition of Al was identified to exert significant effects on the structural formation and physical properties of HEAs due to its relatively larger atomic radius[15–17]. In our previous report, CoCrFeNiTiAl alloy system has been explored and effects of Al addition on the structure and mechanical properties of the as-cast alloys were studied[18]. However, crystal structures of these alloys were simply indexed as BCC and FCC solid-solution without deep-going analysis of the definite phase compositions. On the other hand, the phase formation rule of high-entropy alloys is a research hotspot, which has not yet resolved up to now. As proposed by Yeh et al.[1,6,7], the high mixing entropy (∆Smix) of multi-principal-element alloys was supposed to be the decisive factor for the formation of random solid-solutions over intermetallic compounds. However, Zhang et al. ascertained the mixing enthalpy (∆Hmix), not mixing entropy, was the critical point for the formation of solid-solution structures[19]. Meanwhile, the ordered BCC phase in the widely researched CoCrFeNiCuAl alloy was determined as NiAl intermetallic phase[20]. Thus, the conclusion that HEAs are prone to form simple solid-solutions needs to be revalued. And the XRD patterns simply indexed by crystal structure should be explored thoroughly to check the definitive phase composition.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In this study, CoCrFeNiTiAlxhigh-entropy alloys with varied Al content were fabricated by vacuum arc-melt casting. As thermal stability is an important consideration for industrial applications[21,22], the as-cast CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys were heat treated at 1000 °C for 2 h to study the evolution of phase composition and microstructure after annealing. The annealing condition was confirmed according to the previous study that 1000 °C, 2 h annealing exerted remarkable influence on the structural and properties evolution of CoCrFeNiCuAl alloy[23]. The phase composition and microstructure of as-cast and as-annealed CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys were analyzed intensively. The phase formation rules of HEAs were also explored in this research.",[],[]
2,Experimental details,"Alloy ingots with nominal composition of CoCrFeNiTiAlx(x: molar ratio,x= 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, denoted as Al0, Al0.5, Al1.0, Al1.5, Al2.0respectively) were fabricated using vacuum arc-melt casting under a Ti-gettered high-purity Ar atmosphere with a water-cooled copper mould. Elemental metal sheets and granulars with purity higher than 99 wt% were employed as the raw materials to facilitate the ignition of arc-melt casting. The ingots were remelted four times and flipped after each melt to improve the chemical homogeneity. The prepared samples were subsequently heat treated at 1000 °C for 2 h in flowing argon atmosphere. Phase compositions of the as-cast and as-annealed alloys were characterized by Rigaku Ultima Ⅲ X-ray diffractometer (XRD). Microstructure and chemical compositions were measured using scanning electron microscope (SEM, JSM-5610LV and Hitachi-S3400N) attached with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDX). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEOL JEM-2010) was employed to further identify the crystal structure and morphology of as-cast and as-annealed Al1.0alloys. The thin-foil specimens for TEM measurements were prepared by mechanical thinning followed by electron-polishing and Ar-ion milling.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Characterizations of as-cast and as-annealed CoCrFeNiTi alloys,"Fig. 1presents the X-ray diffraction spectrums and SEM images of as-cast and as-annealed CoCrFeNiTi (Al0) alloys. The XRD results were analyzed intensively to check the definite phase compositions. Different from the conclusion in previous report that as-cast Al0alloy was simply consisted of one FCC solid-solution phase[18], the as-cast Al0alloy actually contains at least two minor phases besides the main FCC solid-solution (Fig. 1(a)). One of the minor phases is confirmed as disordered BCC solid-solution with the strongest diffraction peak (around 43.5°) superimposed with that of FCC solid-solution. According to previous report of CoCrFeNiCuAl alloy[20], the disordered BCC phase is designated as (α-Fe, Cr)-based solid-solution, which is also confirmed in the as-cast CoCrFeNiTi alloy in our research[24]. The other minor phase can be indexed as CoTi2intermetallic compound with corresponding PDF No.07-0141. The lattice constant of CoTi2phase in as-cast Al0alloy is calculated as 1.153 nm from Bragg formula, which is much higher than the given value of 1.129 nm. The expansion of lattice parameter is related with interstitial solid-solution of other elements into the CoTi2crystal lattice. Thus, the definite phase composition of as-cast Al0is listed as follows: multi-principal-element FCC solid-solution as the main phase, (α-Fe, Cr)-based BCC solid-solution and CoTi2-based intermetallic phase as the minor phases. The as-cast Al0alloy exhibits weak contrast in the back-scattered SEM image as shown inFig. 1(b), which means the elemental segregation is not obvious. To clearly observe the surface morphology, the polished surface of as-cast Al0alloy was etched by aqua regia with the resultant image insetted in the upper-right corner ofFig. 1(b). Typical cast-dendrite morphology appears in the etched surface with coarsened dendrite structures separated by interdendrite regions. Elemental composition of the dendrite and interdendrite regions was calculated by EDX with the detailed results listed inTable 1. The dendrite region is slightly enriched with Cr and Fe, while the interdendrite is rich of Co, Ni and Ti. The phase formation and elemental segregation is determined by the mixing enthalpy (∆Hmix) among the constituent metallic elements[18]. Cr and Fe tend to form solid-solution phase as they exhibit low mixing enthalpy near zero. Co and Ni show high negative mixing enthalpy with Ti and they prone to generate intermetallic compounds. Therefore, the dendrite with Cr and Fe enrichment means the dendrite region contains more (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution phase, while the interdendrite region with Co, Ni and Ti enrichment contains more intermetallic phases.","['fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1']",['tbl1']
3.1,Results and discussion.Characterizations of as-cast and as-annealed CoCrFeNiTi alloys,"The FCC solid-solution is retained as the major phase after the as-cast Al0alloy was annealed at 1000 °C for 2 h (Fig. 1(c)). However, increased intermetallic phases appear at the sacrifice of solid-solution phases after annealing. The intermetallic compounds include not only CoTi2phase, but also a newly formed FeTi phase and a complex phase with undetectable crystal structure. The transformation from solid-solutions to intermetallics is induced by the high negative mixing enthalpy between Ti and other elements (e.g. Fe, Ni, Co)[25]. As the alloy was prepared by arc-melt casting equipped with water-cooling equipment, the solid-solution structures formed in the melting state were quenched and maintained after rapid solidification[26,27]. Thus, phase composition of the as-cast Al0alloy is in metastable state, which turns out to be more stable phases after high-temperature annealing. Annealing exhibits negligible effect on the surface morphology of Al0alloy as shown inFig. 1(d). The surface is also in weak contrast with similar cast-dendrite morphology and slightly refined arm-width of the dendrite structure. The as-annealed Al0alloy shows identical elemental segregation as the as-cast alloy, where the dendrite region is rich in Cr and Fe while the interdendrite region rich in Co and Ni. But the two regions of as-annealed Al0alloy are both depleted of Ti element, which may due to the massive precipitation of Ti contained compounds out of the dendrite and interdendrite regions.","['fig1', 'fig1']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Phase compositions of as-cast CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys,"Fig. 2shows the XRD results of as-cast CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys with different Al contents (denoted as Al0.5, Al1.0, Al1.5, Al2.0). The as-cast Al0.5and Al1.0alloys exhibit identical phase composition as shown inFig. 2(b) and (b). A disordered BCC phase, which is identified as (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution, turns out to be the main phase after Al addition. As mentioned above, Al was regarded as a promoter of BCC solid-solution structure and the transformation from FCC to BCC after Al addition was explained by the difference of atomic packing efficiency between FCC and BCC crystal structures[28]. There is an ordered BCC phase located beside the main BCC solid-solution in the XRD spectrum, which was commonly designated as an ordered BCC solid-solution[1,6]. However, this ordered BCC phase was ascertained as NiAl-based intermetallic phase in CoCrFeNiCuAl alloy system[20,29]. Thus, in this study, the ordered BCC phase in CoCrFeNiTiAl system can also be confirmed as NiAl-based intermetallic phase[24]. It was reported that Co demonstrated high solid solubility in NiAl intertemtallic phase[30], which means the ordered BCC phase should be NiAl-based secondary phase with solid-solution of multiple elements. The as-cast Al0.5and Al1.0alloys also contain CoTi2and FeTi typed intermetallic compounds as the minor phases. Thus, the phase composition of as-cast Al0.5and Al1.0alloys can be identically deduced as follows: (α-Fe,Cr)-based BCC solid-solution as the main phase, NiAl-based intermetallic together with CoTi2and FeTi typed compounds as the minor phases.","['fig2', 'fig2']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Phase compositions of as-cast CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys,"The formation of intermetallic phases is greatly suppressed as Al content increases tox= 1.5 andx= 2.0. Only two BCC structured phases exist in the XRD spectrums of as-cast Al1.5and Al2.0alloys (Fig. 2(c) and (d)), where the major phase is disordered BCC solid-solution and the minor one is NiAl-based intermetallic phase. It is evident that Al addition exhibits a remarkable influence on the phase composition of as-cast CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys as the main phase transforms from FCC solid-solution to stabilized BCC solid-solution as Al content increases gradually. The addition of Al would definitely affect the lattice parameter of the formed solid-solution as Al possesses relatively larger atomic radius. It can be seen in the enlarged image of XRD peaks around 43.5° (Fig. 2(e)) that the diffraction peak shifts to the leftward slightly as Al content increases fromx= 0.5 tox= 1.0. This phenomenon is associated with the expansion of crystal lattice induced by substitutional solid-solution of Al[31]. The diffraction peak shifts to the right side as Al content increased tox= 1.5, which is related with the variation of phase composition as the CoTi2and FeTi typed intermetallic phases disappear in the Al1.5alloy. The diffraction peak of BCC2 phase, which is confirmed as NiAl-based intermetallic, shifts to the leftward again as Al content increases fromx= 1.5 tox= 2.0.","['fig2', 'fig2']",[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Microstructure of as-cast CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys,"Fig. 3presents the back-scattered SEM images of as-cast CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys after been etched by aqua regia. Cast-dendrite structure with chrysanthemum-shaped dendrite and river-like interdendrite is typically observed in the as-cast Al0.5and Al1.0alloys (Fig. 3(a) and (b)). The dendrite region is in a eutectic-like morphology with black shells (labeled as “E(A) phase”) located around the grey cores (labeled as “Dendrite”). The core arms of as-cast Al0.5alloy are in coarsened structure with arm-width of about 30–50 μm, which are greatly refined in the as-cast Al1.0alloy. The white interdendrite, grey dendrite and black E(A) phase are in high contrast, which is reflection of distinct elemental segregation. Chemical composition of these areas was analyzed by EDX with the detailed datas listed inTable 2. It is obvious that the dendrite region is rich in Co, Ni and Al, while the interdendrite and E(A) phase exhibit similar elemental enrichment of Cr and Fe. Combined with the XRD results, it is reasonable to deduce that the dendrite region contains massive NiAl-based intermetallic phase while the interdendrite and E(A) phase are rich in (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution. Ti content is higher in the dendrite area than in the other two regions, which means the dendrite region contains more intermetallic phases. The as-cast Al1.5and Al2.0alloys exhibit similar elemental segregation as that of as-cast Al0.5and Al1.0alloys with the disappearance of E(A) phase. The interdendrite regions of as-cast Al1.5alloy can hardly be observed after etching (Fig. 3(c)), which is due to the interdendrite phases are preferentially etched away over the dendrite phases by aqua regia. The etched dendrite is in novel morphology with coarsened grains surrounded by refined particles. This kind of morphology is originated from rapid solidification in the as-cast alloy under unequibrium nucleation and abnormal grain-growth. The amount of interdendrite phase decreases remarkably in the as-cast Al2.0alloy and this area also disappears after etching.","['fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3']",['tbl2']
3.3,Results and discussion.Microstructure of as-cast CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys,"Microstructure of as-cast Al1.0alloy was further characterized by TEM and correspongding selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) with the results presented inFig. 4. Submicro-sized polygonal grains precipitate in the dendrite matrix as shown inFig. 4(a), which should be labeled as intermetallic precipitations. Structure of the dendrite matrix was checked by SAED as the corresponding pattern located in the upper-right corner ofFig. 4(a). This SAED pattern is analyzed to be the superposition result of two diffraction patterns as the stronger one is in disordered BCC structure and the other is ordered BCC. It can be confirmed from previous analysis that the disordered BCC phase is (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution and the ordered BCC phase is NiAl-based intermetallic phase. There is also many dislocation loops precipitated in the dendritic matrix as labeled in the square area ofFig. 4(a). This selected region is magnified inFig. 4(b) with distinct observation of dislocation loops and nanoprecipitations. These dislocation loops are in closed circle shape, which is blocking result of edge dislocations by nanoscaled precipitations[32]. The nanosized grains of the dendrite district are further identified inFig. 4(c) with spherical or elliptical shapes in the dendrite matrix. To further confirm the phase composition of as-cast Al1.0alloy, the interdendrite region was also checked by TEM and SAED as the results shown inFig. 4(d). The interdendrite area is in single disordered BCC structure, indicating this region contains only BCC solid-solution phase. Moreover, a large amount of nanosized grains appear in the interdendrite structure as well. Precipitation of nanosized grains is a novel feature of high-entropy alloys because of the effect of high mixing entropy. From the viewpoint of kinetics, long-range diffusion for phase separation is sluggish in high-entropy alloys with multi-principal elements[1]. Difficulty in substitutional diffusion of elements in these alloys and interactions among interdiffusing species during partitioning lowered the rates of nucleation and growth, inducing to the formation nano-structured crystallites.","['fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4']",[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Microstructure of as-cast CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys,"According to the results of XRD, SEM and TEM, it can be confirmed that the dendrite matrix of as-cast Al1.0alloy is composed of (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution and NiAl-based intermetallic phase while the interdendrite region and E(A) phase are mainly composed of (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution. The CoTi2and FeTi typed intermetallic phases precipitate in both the dendrite and interdendrite districts. Phase composition of the dendrite and interdendrite areas remine almost unchanged as Al content increases tox= 1.5 and 2.0 except for the elimination of CoTi2and FeTi typed intermetallic phases. The solidification process of as-cast Al1.0alloy is analyzed in this study as well. The dendrite structure solidifies in priority with the residual elements be excluded to the remanent liquid region as the arc-melted sample is cooled down rapidly. Elemental segregation is formed in this process as the interdendrite phase solidifies subsequently. As the rapidly cooled dendrite phase is in metastable state, the E(A) phase precipitates out of the dendrite region as the solidification continues, which is a hypoeutectic-like solidification process from metallurgy theory [34]. Thus, an eutectic-like morphology appears in the dendrite region of as-cast Al1.0alloy. This hypoeutectic-like solidification disappears as Al addition increases tox= 1.5, which modifies the solidification behavior and stabilizes the formation of dendrite structure.",[],[]
3.4,Results and discussion.Phase compositions of as-annealed CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys,"The as-cast CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys were heat-treated at 1000 °C for 2 h and their phase composition were characterized by XRD with the resultant spectrums demonstrated inFig. 5. Similar as the as-cast alloys, structure of the main phase transforms to disordered BCC in the as-annealed alloys after Al addition. This means the disordered BCC phase is in high thermal stability withstanding high-temperature annealing. There are also ordered BCC, disordered FCC, CoTi2and FeTi typed intermetallic phases persisted in the as-annealed Al0.5and Al1.0alloys. Compared with the as-cast Al0.5and Al1.0alloys, the content of intermetallic phases in the as-annealed Al0.5and Al1.0alloys increases dramatically. And there is another complex phase with undetectable crystal structure existed in the as-annealed Al0.5and Al1.0alloys. The massive precipitation of intermetallic phases in alloys with low Al content is attributed to the high negative mixing enthalpy of Ti and Al with other elements (e.g. Fe, Ni, Co). The effect of high mixing entropy plays a predominant role when the multi-principal alloys are melted under high-temperature, which makes the formation of intermetallic phase be greatly restrained and the generation of solid-solution phases be promoted[26,27]. The solid-solution structures formed in the melting state are quenched and retained after rapid solidification as the alloys are prepared by arc-melt casting equipped with water-cooling equipment. The effect of mixing enthalpy is incarnated under high-temperature annealing, which leads to the activation of elemental diffusion and eventually the transformation to more stable structures of intermetallic compounds.",['fig5'],[]
3.4,Results and discussion.Phase compositions of as-annealed CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys,"Annealing shows no effect on the phase composition of Al1.5and Al2.0alloys. Formation of intermetallic phases is greatly suppressed as only one ordered BCC phase and one disordered BCC phase appear in the as-annealed Al1.5and Al2.0alloys. The peak density of the ordered BCC phase increases slightly in the as-annealed Al2.0alloy, which means a little increment of NiAl-base intermetallic phase after annealing. This phenomenon further testifies the high thermal stability of NiAl-based intermetallic phase. Al acts as stabilizer of BCC structure and the effect is more obvious in alloys with higher Al content. The lattice constants of as-cast and as-annealed Al2.0alloys are calculated based on the analysis of their XRD spectrums, where the labeled BCC1 and BCC2 phases in the as-cast alloy are 0.2926 nm and 0.2890 nm while the values of the as-annealed alloy are 0.2915 nm and 0.2881 nm. The reduction of lattice parameters after annealing can be regarded as desolution and renovation of solid-solution phases formed in the as-cast alloy. The distortion energy is released and the lattice constant is reduced after high-temperature annealing through the precipitation of excessively soluted metallic components.",[],[]
3.5,Results and discussion.Microstructure of as-annealed CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys,"Fig. 6presents the back-scattered SEM images of as-annealed CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys. All as-annealed alloys exhibit cast-dendrite structure similar as the as-cast alloys. Chrysanthemum like morphology persists and the E(A) structure disappears in the dendrite region of as-annealed Al0.5and Al1.0alloys. The disappearance of E(A) phase is attributed to the desolution of supersaturated metallic elements. The morphology is greatly influenced by annealing as Al content increased tox= 1.5. The area of interdendrite region decreases dramatically after annealing and the dendrite regions are isolated by the river-like interdendrite structure. The decrement of interdendrite phase is also attributed to the resolution of metallic elements after annealing treatment. The morphology of Al2.0alloy remains mostly unchanged after annealing as the dendrite regions exhibit a polycrystalline structure with needle-like interdendrite structure. Chemical composition of the as-annealed alloys was measured by EDX with the detailed values listed inTable 3. The as-annealed alloys reveal identical elemental segregation as the as-cast alloys. The dendrite region is rich in Co, Ni, Ti and Al while the interdendrite region is rich in Cr and Fe. The elemental enrichment is much more obvious in the interdendrite region. The high thermal stability of elemental separation is the reflection of strong bonding among the constituent elements, as well as the enthalpy differences of the elemental pairs. According to the results of XRD, SEM and EDX, it can be confirmed that the interdendrite phases of as-annealed Al0.5and Al1.0alloys are mainly composed of (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution while the dendrite regions contain NiAl-based intermetallic phase and (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution. The other intermetallic compounds disperse in both the dendrite and interdendrite districts. As Al content increases tox= 1.5 and 2.0, the interdendrite regions of the as-annealed alloys are simply composed of (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution while the dendrite phases include (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution and NiAl-based intermetallic phases.",['fig6'],['tbl3']
3.5,Results and discussion.Microstructure of as-annealed CoCrFeNiTiAlxalloys,"Fig. 7shows the bright-field TEM images and corresponding SAED pattern in the dendrite region of as-annealed Al1.0alloy. It is revealed inFig. 7(a) that the dendritic region is mainly consisted of submicro-sized grains without obvious dispersion of nanoprecipitates. Crystal structure of the dendrite phase is examined by SAED with the pattern insetted in the upper-right corner ofFig. 7(a). It is analyzed that the SAED pattern is overlapping result from two sets of SAED spots, where the stronger one is in disordered cubic structure and the other is in hexagonal crystal structure. The disordered cubic structure is the reflection of (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution phase while the hexagonal structure should be the reflection of one intermetallic compound. As the detected area of SAED analysis is limited, phase composition of the dendrite region can hardly be confirmed by only TEM analysis. However, the TEM results once again testify that the dendrite region includes (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution phase and intermetallic compounds, which is in agreement with the previous deduction of phase composition. Nanoprecipitates are also found in some submicro-sized grains under deliberate analysis as shown inFig. 7(a). This phenomenon means the annealing under 1000 °C for 2 h is inadequate for the relieving of the sluggish diffusion induced by the effect of high mixing entropy.","['fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7']",[]
3.6,Results and discussion.Phase formation rules of HEAs,"Formation of simple solid-solutions is deemed as a novel feature in multi-principal HEAs. The formation mechanism of solid-solutions in HEAs is related as the effect of high-mixing entropy. Alloys with multi-principal elements will more easily yield the formation of random solid-solutions during solidification rather than intermetallic compounds[1–3]. Many high-entropy alloy systems have been researched in recent years but not every alloy system necessarily form simple solid-solutions[19]. Up till now, the existing formation rules of solid-solution are mainly based on alloys with one or two principal components. According to the Hume-Rothery theory for high degree of solubility in binary alloy systems[33], the formation of solid-solution is affected by the following four factors: (1) difference of atomic size; (2) electron negativity; (3) crystal structure and (4) chemical valence. It is hard to form substitutional solid-solution for alloys with atom-size difference over 15% and electron negativity higher than 0.4. However, the solid-solution formation rules of HEAs should be different because there are many high-entropy alloy systems beyond the Hume-Rothery rules show phase composition of simple solid-solutions. As HEAs possess more principal elements than traditional alloys, the components have the same probability to occupy the lattice sites to form solid-solution. Therefore, the formation rules for HEAs should be extended over traditional alloys.",[],[]
3.6,Results and discussion.Phase formation rules of HEAs,"Zhang et al have studied the formation rules of solid-solutions for HEAs[19]. Not only the effect of mixing entropy (∆Smix), but also mixing enthalpy (∆Hmix) and atom-size difference (δ) of the alloy system should be considered integrally. For the promotion of simple solid-solutions, the values of ∆Hmixandδshould near zero on the basis of high mixing entropy. Although systematic factors for the formation of solid-solution have been proposed, there is no quantitative criterion for the phase formation of HEAs. In this study, various high-entropy alloy systems have been employed to explore the quantitative criterion of the phase formation rules. The values of ∆Smix, ∆Hmixandδwere calculated from the formulas proposed in our previous research[24]. The corresponding values of these alloy systems and their phase compositions are analyzed and listed inTable 4. The analyzed alloy systems meet the definition of high-entropy alloy as they contain at least five components with equiatomic composition. Thus, the effect of ∆Hmixandδon the phase formation is stressed with the ∆Hmixandδvalues of these high-entropy alloy systems plotted inFig. 8. Only CoCrFeNiCu, CoCrFeNiMn and CoCrFeNiV high-entropy alloys demonstrate similar phase composition of simple solid-solution phases. The ∆Hmixandδvalues of these alloys approach zero as their positions located at the upper-left corner ofFig. 8. However, the other alloys with ∆Hmixandδvalues beyond the upper-left corner contain not only solid-solution phases but also intermetallic compounds. Therefore, the formation criterion of simple solid-solution for high-entropy alloys should be the ∆Smixandδvalues fall into the upper-left district inFig. 8under the fulfillment of high mixing entropy (∆Smix≥ 1.61R). To be specific, the quantitative criterion for the formation of simple solid-solutions is ∆Smix≥ 13.38 J/K·mol, −10 kJ/mol ≤ ∆Hmix≤ 5 kJ/mol andδ≤ 4. For traditional alloy systems, the effect of systematic mixing enthalpy (∆Hmix) is much higher than the mixing entropy (∆Smix) in the process of phase formation and the structural formation is mainly determined by ∆Hmix. However, the effect of ∆Smixis greatly enhanced in high-entropy alloys, which may be high enough to dominate the phase formation and physical properties in these alloys. According to the above mentioned analysis, we can deduce that the resultant structure of HEAs is the competition outcome of ∆Smix, ∆Hmixandδ. ∆Smixwill dominate the phase formation process to form simple solid-solutions only under the condition that the effect of ∆Hmixandδis negligible in the alloy system. Otherwise, ∆Hmixandδwill demonstrate their influence with the generation of intermetallic compounds.","['fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8']",['tbl4']
4,Conclusions,"In this study, CoCrFeNiTiAlxhigh-entropy alloys were prepared from vacuum arc-melt casting and the as-cast alloys were subsequently annealed at 1000 °C for 2 h. Al addition exhibits significant influence on phase composition and microstructure of both the as-cast and as-annealed alloys. The alloy without Al addition is mainly composed of FCC solid-solution while the main phase transforms to stabilized BCC solid-solution as Al is introduced. Definite phase compositions of these alloys were ascertained as the previously reported ordered BCC solid-solution is actually NiAl-based intermetallic phase and the disordered BCC solid-solution is (α-Fe,Cr)-based solid-solution. Eutectic-like dendrite structure appears in the as-cast Al0.5and Al1.0alloys, which disappears after excessive addition of Al and high-temperature annealing. Obvious elemental segregation can be detected in the dendrite and interdendrite regions for both as-cast and as-annealed alloys. Annealing demonstrates no obvious influence on the main phase and elemental segregation except for the increment of intermetallic phases for alloys with low Al content (x= 0, 0.5 and 1.0).
