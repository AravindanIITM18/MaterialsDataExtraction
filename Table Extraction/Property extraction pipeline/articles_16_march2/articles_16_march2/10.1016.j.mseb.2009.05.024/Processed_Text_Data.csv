0,Abstract,"Al                        x                     CoCrFeNi (0≤                     x                     ≤2) alloys were prepared by an arc remelter and investigated. With increasing x, the Al                        x                     CoCrFeNi alloys change from single FCC phase to single BCC phase with a transition duplex FCC/BCC region. The weak X-ray diffraction intensities indicate severe X-ray scattering effect of lattice in these high-entropy alloys. Electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity much smaller than those of pure component metals is ascribed as due to this lattice effect. The behavior of electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity can be divided into three parts according to microstructure. Both values of electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity decrease with increasing x in single-phase regions. Values of electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity are even higher than those in the duplex phase region because of the additional scattering effect of FCC/BCC phase boundaries in the alloys. Relative contribution of electron and phonon to electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity is evaluated in this study. It is shown that both electron and phonon components are comparable in these high-entropy alloys, and their transport properties are similar to that of semi-metal.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-entropy alloy is a new alloy design that was invented by Yeh et al.[1,2]in 1995. High-entropy alloy generally contains 5–13 major elements whose concentration is between 5 and 35at.%. Studies have shown that high-entropy alloy has novel properties compared to conventional alloys[2–6]. These properties include good thermal stability, easier to form nano-scale precipitation, high hardness, and superior resistance to wear, corrosion and oxidation. High-entropy alloy possesses simple crystal structure with solid solution of multiple elements. Previous works show that AlxCoCrFeNi alloys change from FCC to BCC and the hardness increases from Hv 120 to Hv 520 asxincreases[7].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Although a large number of studies have been done on microstructure and mechanical properties, there are few studies regarding the thermal and electrical properties of the high-entropy alloys[7–9]. Therefore in this study electrical resistivity and thermal conductivity of AlxCoCrFeNi alloys are investigated. Results are discussed in terms of Al content, temperature, and microstructure. It shows that AlxCoCrFeNi alloys easily form simple phase. The electrical resistivity of AlxCoCrFeNi alloys is principally controlled by electron–electron interaction, magnetic effect, and phonon at temperatures in 4–300K, and solely by phonon at temperatures in 300–400K. The phonon contribution to thermal conductivity actually is comparable with the electronic contribution. The ratio of phonon to electronic contribution ranges from 0.64 to 2.66 asxincreases. Thermal expansion measurements show invar-type thermal expansion anomaly indicting that the alloys are of ferromagnetic with Curie temperatures ranging from 781.2K to 869.2K.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedure,"Al, Co, Cr, Fe, and Ni with purity larger than 99.5% are used. A total of 40–50g materials were used to prepared AlxCoCrFeNi (0≤x≤2) alloys by vacuum arc-smelter. After the alloys were re-melted, they were turned over to melt at least three times to insure that the alloys were well mixed. As-cast alloys were heated with a rate of 10°C/min to 1100°C and stayed for 24h. Then the samples were water quenched.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedure,"The crystal structure was identified by RIGAKU ME510-FM2 X-ray diffractometer. The 1.5405Å Cu target was used, and the working voltage and current were 30kV and 20mA, respectively. The scanning rate was 4°min−1, and the 2θscanning range was 20–100°. Lattice parameter,ao, for eachx-alloy in AlxCoCrFeNi (0≤x≤2) is obtained by usinga(θ)=ao(1+Kcos2θ/sinθ) in thea(θ) plot[10]. High-temperature XRD (HTXRD) at an interval of 50°C from 500°C to 700°C was performed with a heating rate of 20°C/min and a holding time for 1/2h at testing temperature before examination. Test pieces were compacted filing powders of 0.4mm thick, and were vacuum-annealed under 10−3torr at 500°C for 5h before HTXRD.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedure,"Four-point probe method was used to measure the electrical resistance (R). Platinum wires with radius of 0.05mm were connected to the samples by Indium. The heating rate was 10K/min, and the electrical resistance was measured from 300K to 400K. The error is estimated to ±3%.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedure,The alloy density was determined by the Archimedes method. A differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to measure variation of heat capacity with temperature. Thermal diffusivity was measured by means of the laser flash method from 298K to 573K. Accuracy is within ±0.8%. The samples were prepared in disk with diameter of 12.7mm and thickness of 2mm.,[],[]
2,Experimental procedure,"As-surface polished samples for measurement of thermal expansion coefficient are of 4mm in diameter, and 4mm in thickness, and with good surface finish. Measurements were carried out in Du Pont TMA 2940 with 10°C/min of heating from 25°C to 800°C and under 400sccm of Ar flow. Pyris Diamond TG/DTA of the Perkin-Elmer Instruments was used to examine phase change of samples of 20–50mg in an Al2O3crucible at temperatures from 25°C to 900°C at a rate of heating of 10°C/min and under 400sccm of Ar flow.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.XRD," Fig. 1 shows XRD patterns of AlxCoCrFeNi alloys. It indicates that alloys are single-FCC, duplex FCC/BCC, and single-BCC for 0≤x≤0.375, 0.5≤x≤1, and 1.25≤x≤2, respectively. Al is also a BCC stabilizer in AlxCoCrFeNi alloys as well as inAlxCoyCrzCu0.5FevNiwalloys[11]. However, in the presence of Cu inAlxCoyCrzCu0.5FevNiwalloys segregation of Cu is generally observed. Therefore we omit the Cu addition in this study. Table 1 tabulates crystal structures, lattice parameters, weight fractions of FCC and BCC phases in duplex region and relative XRD intensity in both single-FCC and single-BCC regions. It is seen that only FCC and/or BCC are present, whether in single-phase or in duplex-phase form, in AlxCoCrFeNi alloys. Both lattice parameters in single-phase regions increase with increase inx, as well as those in duplex region, which increase roughly withx, while the relative XRD intensity in both single-phase regions decreases withx. The relative XRD intensity in both single-phase regions decreases withxtells one that the X-ray diffusive scattering effect increases with increasing Al addition in both single-phase regions (see Fig. 1(b) ). The diffusive scattering effect is explained due to larger lattice distortion caused by larger amount of larger atomic size (1.43Å in radius) of Al into the lattice of smaller atoms (about 1.25Å in radius for other atoms). The phenomenon also presents in Cu–Ni–Al–Co–Cr–Fe–Si alloy system, as alloys in this system increase their component from binary to 7-component due to the difference from addition of different atoms that causes lattice distortion the degree of diffuse of X-ray scattering increases and the intensities decrease significantly[12]. This effect is considered important in explaining the behavior of both thermal and electrical conductivity that will discuss below.","['fig1', 'fig1']",['tbl1']
3.2,Results and discussion.Electrical resistivity," Fig. 2(a)  is a plot of electrical resistivity as a function of temperature. It is seen in Fig. 2(a) , the electrical resistivity is approximately a linear function of temperature with a positive slope in the temperature range of 298–400K. This indicates that the electrical resistivity of the alloys is principally affected by phonon and the temperature range is above the Debye temperature of the alloys from the conventional theory of electrical resistivity[13]. Fig. 2(c)  shows the electrical conductivity as a function of compositionxin AlxCoCrFeNi. The electrical conductivityσfor AlxCoCrFeNi can be divided in three parts according to microstructure of the alloys. As discussed in previous section the microstructure has three regions, single-FCC in 0≤x≤0.375, single-BCC in 1.25≤x≤2, and duplex FCC–BCC in 0.5≤x≤1. The electrical conductivity decreases with increasingxin single-phase regions, while it has a minimum atx=0.875 in the duplex phase region. The electrical conductivity in the duplex phase region is smaller than that in the single-phase region.","['fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Electrical resistivity,"Electrical resistivity of materials is generally controlled by various factors such as temperature and composition[14–16]. For alloys at temperatures lower than the Debye temperature where thermal effect is low, electrical resistivity is influenced by electron–electron interaction (T1/2), magnetic effect (T2), and phonon (T3). At temperature very near absolute zero temperature a Kondo-type term, lnT, may appear in the expression of electrical resistivity for dilute magnetic atoms in nonmagnetic alloys[13]. At intermediate temperatures, e.g., 100–200K,TandT2may contribute to electrical resistivity. At temperatures higher than the Debye temperature where thermal effect is significant, electrical resistivity is proportional to temperatureT, and electrical resistivityρmay be written asρ=ρo+cT[16]. Fig. 2(b)  shows electrical resistivity at temperatures in 4–400K for AlxCoCrFeNi (x=1, 1.5 and 2) alloys. Because of uncontrollable experimental reasons there is deviation for data at 300K. However, we still can see the effect of temperature on the electrical resistivity. It is concluded that electrical resistivity of AlxCoCrFeNi (x=0–2) alloys is principally controlled by electron–electron interaction (T1/2), magnetic effect (T2), and phonon (T3) at temperatures in 4–300K, and by phonon (T) at temperatures in 300–400K.",['fig2'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity,This part of study aims to understand the thermal conductivityκ(T) of AlxCoCrFeNi (0≤x≤2) alloys. The relation betweenκ(T) andTis first discussed. Then the Wiedemann–Franz law is applied to examine the phonon to electronic contribution to thermal conductivity.,[],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity,"Thermal conductivityκ(T) is generally obtained from measurements of thermal diffusion coefficientα(T), specific heatS(T), and densityρ(T) of a material at a temperatureT, and then calculated according to equationκ(T)=α(T)×S(T)×ρ(T)[17]. It is a measure of thermal conducting capability of a material. Fig. 3(a) shows thermal conductivity of alloys in this study as a function of temperature. It is seen thatκ(T) for AlxCoCrFeNi (0≤x≤2) alloys increases with temperature, contrary to that of pure metal. For pure metals the collision frequency of electrons with phonons of lattices increases with temperature, enabling a shorter mean free path, and a decrease in thermal conductivity. Due to a smaller carrier concentration (1019–1021cm−3in temperature range of 4–300K), carrier concentration decreasing with temperature[7]and lattice distortion effect that making a low sensitivity of phonon concentration with respect to temperature as well as a larger linear thermal expansion in these alloys, the mean free path of electrons increases with temperature. This explains whyκ(T) for AlxCoCrFeNi (0≤x≤2) alloys increases with temperature in Fig. 3(a) . Fig. 3(b)  shows thermal conductivity of alloys as a function ofx. At a specificT,κ(x) decreases withxin each single-phase region for both FCC and BCC regions, andκ(BCC) is greater thanκ(FCC). Thermal conductivity in the FCC+BCC duplex region,κ(FCC+BCC) is the lowest for each specificT. This phenomenon is easily understood. Since in each single-phase region, and the larger scattering effect for larger lattice distortion due to Al addition evidenced from the above-mentioned XRD patterns, thereforeκ(x) decreases withxin each single-phase region for both FCC and BCC regions at a specificT. The BCC structure possesses more open space (32%) than the FCC structure does (26%) as well as a higher Young's modulusE, and a higher phonon velocity,υph=(E/ρ)1/2,κ(BCC) is greater thanκ(FCC) accordingly. Because there exists a more interface boundary in duplex-phase region than in single-phase region, the thermal conductivity in the FCC+BCC duplex region,κ(FCC+BCC), is the lowest for each specificT.","['fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3']",[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity,"In pure metals thermal conductivity is mainly from electronic contribution at all temperatures. At not too low temperatures according to the Wiedemann–Franz law (WF law),κ/σ=LT, the ratio of thermal conductivity to electrical conductivity is directly proportional to temperature, with the valueLof the constant of proportionality independent of the particular metal[13,18]. In impure or disordered alloys such as alloys in this study, electron mean free path is reduced by collision with impurities, and the phonon contribution may be comparable with the electronic contribution[13]. In this case, theκterm is divided in two parts,κ=κe+κph, whereκeis the electronic part andκphis the phonon part[19,20]. Therefore, the value ofL( Fig. 4 ) may be written asL=Le+Lph, whereLeis the proportionality contributed by electrons,Lphthat by phonons, andLe=Lo=2.45×10−8WΩ/K2, the Lorenz number. If we rewrite WF law asκ=κe+κph=LσT=(Lo+Lph)σT, we may use this equation and from related experimental data to calculateκeandκphfromκe=LoσTandκph=LphσT, respectively. The results of calculation are listed in Table 2 . Table 2 indicates that the phonon contribution to thermal conductivity,κph, is actually comparable with the electronic contribution,κe. The ratio ofκph/κeranges from 0.64 to 2.66 for AlxCoCrFeNi alloys in this study. Table 3 lists the carrier concentration, resistivity, and comparison ofκewithκph, for various materials. It shows that AlxCoCrFeNi alloys are of semi-metals.",['fig4'],"['tbl2', 'tbl2', 'tbl3']"
3.4,Results and discussion.Thermal expansion,"The coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) of as-homogenized AlxCoCrFeNi alloys decreases withx( Table 4 ). According to the theory of thermal expansion, in lowest order the thermal expansion 〈d〉 can be written as 〈d〉=(3g/4c2)kBTunder a potential energy of a formU(d)=cd2+gd3, wheredis a displacement equilibrium separation for atoms at absolute zero, andcandgare positive[22]. Therefore the thermal expansion coefficient of as-homogenized AlxCoCrFeNi alloys decreases withxmeans that (3g/4c2) decreases withxin alloys. Fig. 5 shows variation of thermal expansion of as-homogenized AlxCoCrFeNi alloys with temperature in the range of 423–1073K. In this figure except curves for H-0.875 and H-1 that have two minima, i.e., 781.2K and 940K, and 844.1K and 920K, respectively, all curves have only single minimum. In order to understand this anomaly in CTE we performed high-temperature XRD (HTXRD) from 773K to 973K, and DTA from 300K to about 1200K to examine in situ microstructure and to look for existence of phase transformation, respectively. Fig. 6 presents results of DTA ( Fig. 6(a) ) and HTXRD ( Fig. 6(b) ). For comparison simplicity in Fig. 6(a) , we show only two DTA tracing curves for H-0.875 and H-1 that have two minima in Fig. 5 , and one DTA tracing curve for H-0.75 that has typically one minimum in Fig. 5 . One can easily see one minimum in each DTA tracing curve for H-0.875 (930K) and H-1 (910K), while there is no such minimum for H-0.75 in the testing temperature range, indicating that H-0.875 and H-1 have phase transition in the range of testing temperatures, while H-0.75 does not. The phase transition for H-0.875 was checked by in situ XRD from 773K to 973K at an interval of 50K and is shown in Fig. 6(b) , and is identified as precipitation of σ phase that has a NiCoCr structure and is present at temperatures higher than 873K. This temperature is lower than the transition temperature (930–940K) obtained from CTE and DTA, but is higher than the temperature (781.2K) of the first minimum in CTE curve. Since the precipitation of σ phase is a diffusion process, especially for multicomponent alloys[23], its occurrence will delay during CTE and DTA measurements. It is no wonder that the transition temperature (930–940K) obtained from CTE and DTA must be higher than 873K ( Fig. 7 ).","['fig5', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig5', 'fig5', 'fig6', 'fig7']",['tbl4']
3.4,Results and discussion.Thermal expansion,"The first minimum in CTE curves is attributed as caused by the invar-type thermal expansion anomaly, i.e., as temperature rises in addition to the normal thermal expansion due to anharmonic effects in crystals, there is an additional portion of expansion due to magnetic ordering[24–26]. This portion of expansion due to magnetic ordering decreases with degree of disordering as temperature increases, and vanishes at Curie or Néel temperature and higher temperatures so that there is a minimum in CTE at Curie or Néel temperature. AlxCoCrFeNi alloys are ferromagnetic[7], showing the invar-type thermal expansion anomaly. The Curie temperatures obtained from the invar effect in CTE measurements show slightly increase withxin the FCC- and BCC-single-phase regions, while there is a minimum for Curie temperature in the duplex FCC+BCC structure region in this study ( Fig. 8 ). By use of the invar effect to measure this second order phase transition one can have accurate data for Curie temperature. We also estimate the corresponding molecular field of the order of 107Oe shown in Fig. 8 by assuming the magnetization of each alloy being with one Bohr magneton[27].","['fig8', 'fig8']",[]
