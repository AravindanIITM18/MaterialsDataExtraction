fig1,articles_all/10.1016.j.mseb.2009.05.024/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,"XRD patterns for AlxCoCrFeNi alloys. (a) All alloys, and (b) main peak in single-phase alloys, i.e. (111) for FCC and (110) for BCC, are shown. The shaded area in H-0 in (b) indicates how the relative intensity in the XRD peaks is calculated."
fig2,articles_all/10.1016.j.mseb.2009.05.024/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,"Diagrams for (a) electrical resistivity at temperatures in 300–400K, (b) electrical resistivity at temperatures in 4–400K, and (c) electrical conductivity vs.xin AlxCoCrFeNi alloys."
fig3,articles_all/10.1016.j.mseb.2009.05.024/figures/gr3.jpg,Fig. 3,"Diagrams for curves of thermal conductivity as a function of temperature (a), and as a function ofxin AlxCoCrFeNi alloys (b), respectively."
fig4,articles_all/10.1016.j.mseb.2009.05.024/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,Lorenz numbers for AlxCoCrFeNi alloys vs. temperature.
fig5,articles_all/10.1016.j.mseb.2009.05.024/figures/gr5.jpg,Fig. 5,"Variation of thermal expansion coefficient with temperature of AlxCoCrFeNi alloys. The maximum and minimum values are shown at the upper left-hand side of each curve, and the Curie temperature is shown in the gray region. Note that there is another “valley” for H-0.875 and H-1 in the figure. The interval in CTE coordinate is 15×10−6K−1."
fig6,articles_all/10.1016.j.mseb.2009.05.024/figures/gr6.jpg,Fig. 6,"(a) DTA curves of AlxCoCrFeNi alloys forx=0.75, 0.875, and 1. (b) HTXRD patterns for Al0.875CoCrFeNi alloy at temperatures from 773K to 973K, showing the presence of another phase, σ=NiCoCr, except α and γ solid solution phases at temperature 923K and 973K, and indicating precipitation of σ at temperature equal to or higher than 873K."
