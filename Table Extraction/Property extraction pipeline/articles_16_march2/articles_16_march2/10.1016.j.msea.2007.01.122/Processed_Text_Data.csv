0,Abstract,"High-entropy alloys are newly developed alloys that are composed, by definition, of at least five principal elements with concentrations in the range of 5–35at.%. Therefore, the alloying behavior of any given principal element is significantly affected by all the other principal elements present. In order to elucidate this further, the influence of iron, silver and gold addition on the microstructure and hardness of AlCoCrCuNi-based equimolar alloys has been examined. The as-cast AlCoCrCuNi base alloy is found to have a dendritic structure, of which only solid solution FCC and BCC phases can be observed. The BCC dendrite has a chemical composition close to that of the nominal alloy, with a deficiency in copper however, which is found to segregate and form a FCC Cu-rich interdendrite. The microstructure of the iron containing alloys is similar to that of the base alloy. It is found that both of these aforementioned alloys have hardnesses of about 420HV, which is equated to their similar microstructures. The as-cast ingot forms two layers of distinct composition with the addition of silver. These layers, which are gold and silver in color, are determined to have a hypoeutectic Ag–Cu composition and a multielement mixture of the other principal elements, respectively. This indicates the chemical incompatibility of silver with the other principal elements. The hardnesses of the gold (104HV) and silver layers (451HV) are the lowest and highest of the alloy systems studied. This is attributed to the hypoeutectic Ag–Cu composition of the former and the reduced copper content of the latter. Only multielement mixtures, i.e. without copper segregation, form in the gold containing alloy. Thus, it may be said that gold acts as a ‘mixing agent’ between copper and the other elements. Although several of the atom pairs in the gold containing alloy have positive enthalpies, thermodynamic considerations show that the high entropy contribution is sufficient to counterbalance these positive enthalpies, and permit effective mixing. The considerably higher positive enthalpies between the elements of the silver alloy, however, are too great to be counterbalanced by the entropy. This work highlights the importance of the entropy contribution and mixing enthalpy between atom pairs, i.e. bonding energy, on the structural evolution and related properties of high-entropy alloys, and provides essential information for the future development of this new breed of alloy system.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"For thousands of years the development of practical alloy systems has been based typically on the use of one principal element as the matrix. Although substantial additions of other elements may be incorporated into these alloys for property and/or processing enhancement, the limit of one principal element significantly reduces the number of possible alloy systems that can be fabricated[1,2]. In recent years, however, Yeh et al.[3]have explored an entirely new class of alloys, coined as high-entropy alloys, which are defined as alloys that have at least five principal elements with concentrations between 5 and 35at.%. These alloys are found to consist typically of multiprincipal element solid solution phases, as opposed to the anticipated formation of a multitude of complicated and brittle intermetallic compounds[3–9]. This is attributed to the large mixing entropy (ΔSm) of such multiprincipal element solutions counterbalancing the enthalpy term (ΔHm) in the relationship for the Gibbs free energy of mixing (ΔGm):(1)ΔGm=ΔHm−TΔSmAt lower temperatures, when the contribution of the mixing entropy is reduced, it is found that nanoprecipitation can occur[7]. These structural characteristics, i.e. multiprincipal element solid solution phases with nanoprecipitation, are found to provide high-entropy alloys with a combination of promising properties, such as high hardness, large work hardening capacity, and superior resistance to temper softening, wear, oxidation and corrosion[3–11]. It has been found, however, that the large mixing entropy may not be sufficient to prevent the segregation of some very chemically incompatible elements[3].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Due to their similar concentrations, the alloying behavior of any one principal element is substantially affected by the other principal elements present in high-entropy alloys. The microstructure and the properties are in turn significantly influenced by these different alloying behaviors. In order to further elucidate the extent of compatibility, or alloying, between different elements in high-entropy alloys and provide a greater understanding of the important factors for alloy design, the influence of adding iron, silver and gold, each with different chemical and physical properties, to a base alloy of AlCoCrCuNi shall be investigated in terms of the effect on microstructure and hardness.",[],[]
2,Experimental details,"The equimolar alloys of AlCoCrCuNi, AlCoCrCuFeNi, AgAlCoCrCuNi and AlAuCoCrCuNi, were prepared by the arc melting and casting method, as described in Ref.[5]. The alloy specimens were polished and etched withaqua regiafor observation with an optical microscope and scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-5410). The chemical compositions of the different phases were analyzed by SEM energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). An X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku ME510-FM2), with the 2θscan ranging from 20 to 100° at a speed of 1°min−1, was used for identifying the crystal structure. The typical radiation condition of the copper target was 30kV and 20mA. Hardness measurements were conducted using a Vickers hardness tester (Matsuzawa Seiki MV-1) under a load of 49N and at a loading speed of 70μm/s for 20s. The average hardness and standard error were determined from five random indents.",[],[]
3.1,Results.AlCoCrCuNi alloy,"The XRD pattern of the AlCoCrCuNi alloy in Fig. 1(a) reveals that it is composed of only BCC and FCC solid-solution phases, i.e. no intermetallic phases can be seen. An ordered BCC phase (B2) is noted by the peak at about 31°. The XRD peak intensities suggest that the volume fraction of BCC is greater than FCC.",['fig1'],[]
3.1,Results.AlCoCrCuNi alloy," Fig. 2 shows that the alloy has a typical cast dendritic structure; with the dendrite and interdendrite regions defined as DR and ID, respectively. The modulated structure of the dendrite region, consisting of BCC and ordered BCC (B2) phases, is considered to result from spinodal decomposition, as previously reported and discussed in detail for AlxCoCrCuFeNi high entropy alloys (x=0–3)[7]. Thus, the FCC phase is of the interdendrite region. From Fig. 2 , there can be seen to be a higher volume fraction of dendrite than interdendrite. This is in agreement with the relative peak intensities of the BCC and FCC phases, ascribed to the dendrite and interdendrite, respectively, in the XRD pattern.","['fig2', 'fig2']",[]
3.1,Results.AlCoCrCuNi alloy,"The EDX chemical composition of the cast alloy is listed in Table 1 . Apart from a reduction in copper concentration as a result of its segregation to the interdendrite region, the majority dendrite is noted to have a composition similar to that originally designated to the alloy. The segregation of Cu can be explained by the positive mixing enthalpies of +6, +12 and +4kJ/mol between Cu and Co, Cr and Ni, respectively[12]. Thus, these elements, particularly Cr, repel copper from the dendrite region. On a similar note, the higher concentrations of Al and Ni in the interdendrite region, of 13 and 15at.%, respectively, can be related to the negative mixing enthalpies between Cu–Al and Al–Ni pairs of −1 and −22kJ/mol, respectively[12,14], in which copper and aluminum are considered to correspondingly attract aluminum and nickel to the interdendrite region.",[],['tbl1']
3.2,Results.Fe addition to AlCoCrCuNi alloy,"The crystal structure and microstructure of the AlCoCrCuFeNi alloy, shown in Figs.1(b) and3, respectively, are seen to be similar to those of the AlCoCrCuNi base alloy. The EDX chemical composition of the AlCoCrCuFeNi cast alloy in Table 1 shows that the majority dendrite region has a composition close to that of the nominal alloy apart from a reduced copper content. The reduced copper content is attributed to copper segregation to the interdendrite region, as found for the base alloy. These observations can be explained by the negative mixing enthalpies of −11, −1, −1 and −2kJ/mol between Fe and Al, Co, Cr and Ni, respectively[12], and its positive mixing enthalpy of +13kJ/mol with Cu[12]. Thus, iron is effectively adopted into the dendrite region of the base alloy, while copper is again repelled by the majority of the dendrite elements to form a copper-rich interdendrite.","['fig1', 'fig3']",['tbl1']
3.3,Results.Ag addition to AlCoCrCuNi alloy,"It is found with Ag addition to the base alloy that the cast ingot separates into two distinct layers, which are gold and silver in color. From EDX analysis, it is found that the golden layer is predominantly Ag with some Cu and trace Al. The silver layer, apart from the significant deficiency of Ag, has a multiprincipal element composition of the other alloy elements. The multielement layer is found to solidify at the top of the cast ingot. This is ascribed to its lower density and higher melting point. The formation of these two layers can be related to the large miscibility gap that exists in the liquid state of the Ag–Co, Ag–Cr and Ag–Ni binary phase diagrams[13]. This in turn is a result of the large positive mixing enthalpies of +19, +27 and +15kJ/mol between the Ag–Co, Ag–Cr and Ag–Ni pairs, respectively[12]. This indicates that the high entropy contribution of six element equimolar mixtures is not sufficient to promote the effective mixing between highly incompatible elements, such as Ag with Co, Cr and Ni.",[],[]
3.3,Results.Ag addition to AlCoCrCuNi alloy,"The microstructure and corresponding EDX of the Ag-rich golden layer are shown in Fig. 4 (a–c). It can be seen that this layer has a dendritic structure. From EDX, it is determined that the dendrite is Ag-rich, while the interdendrite is a mixture of Ag and Cu. In accordance with the silver–copper phase diagram[13], the golden layer is determined to be a hypoeutectic Ag–Cu alloy, in which the liquid lying between the proeutectic Ag-rich dendrite arms has the eutectic composition and freezes to form a eutectic structure. Further validation of this is obtained from the XRD data ( Fig. 1 (c1)), where the calculated lattice constants of 4.04 and 3.65Å are close to those of 4.09 and 3.62Å for pure Ag and Cu. The discrepancy between these lattice constants can be accounted for by the larger atomic size of Ag (1.45Å) than Cu (1.28Å).","['fig4', 'fig1']",[]
3.3,Results.Ag addition to AlCoCrCuNi alloy,"The silver layer ( Fig. 5(a) ) is seen to have a small fraction of a globule-like phase within the majority dendritic structure. From EDX analysis ( Fig. 5(b) ) it is found that the globule-like phase has a composition similar to that of the golden layer. Moreover, through closer inspection, the globule-like phase can be seen to have a hypoeutectic Ag–Cu microstructure. Both the globule-shape and structure suggest that this phase forms from a Ag-rich liquid droplet trapped within the solidified multielement silver layer. The dendrite phase, i.e. the main phase, of the silver layer has a multielement composition of principally Al, Co, Cr and Ni, with a lesser amount of Cu ( Fig. 5(c) ). Ag could not be detected within the dendrite region. The interdendrite phase is found to consist principally of copper, as was observed for the AlCoCrCuNi and AlCoCrCuFeNi alloys above. From XRD analysis ( Fig. 1 (c2)), it is determined that the silver layer consists of a mixture of Ag-rich, Cu-rich FCC, BCC and ordered BCC phases. The peaks of the Ag- and Ag–Cu-rich phases are relatively low in comparison to those of the golden layer. This is related to the low volume fraction of this phase within the silver layer. The predominant BCC and ordered BCC phases correspond to the principal dendrite region, and the FCC phase to the Cu-rich interdendrite.","['fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5', 'fig1']",[]
3.4,Results.Au addition to AlCoCrCuNi alloy,"From Fig. 6 , it can be seen that the equimolar AlAuCoCrCuNi alloy has a dendritic structure with comparable volume fractions of dendrite and interdendrite. Inspection of the EDX scans in Fig. 6 (b and c) for the dendrite and interdendrite phases, respectively, shows that all six principal elements are present in both, with however, a lower Au content in the dendrite region. This indicates that gold, being nobler, is able to mix more effectively than silver with the other five elements. In comparison with the AlCoCrCuNi alloy, it is also found that the copper of the AlAuCoCrCuNi alloy does not segregate to form a separate Cu-rich interdendrite phase. This is considered to be a result of Cu segregation being inhibited as a result of its relatively high negative mixing enthalpy with Au (−9kJ/mol[14]). Thus, one may say that gold appears to function as a ‘mixing agent’ between copper and the other elements. From the XRD pattern in Fig. 1(d) , it can be seen that the AlAuCoCrCuNi alloy is composed of FCC and AuCu phases. In accordance with its higher content of gold and copper, the Au–Cu phase is considered to form in the interdendrite region. In view of the mixing enthalpies of −22, +7, −9, 0 and +7kJ/mol for the Au–Al, Au–Co, Au–Cu, Au–Cr and Au–Ni pairs, respectively[12,14], it can be noted that the Au–Co and Au–Ni pairs have relatively high positive mixing enthalpies. The high mixing entropy of these multiprincipal element solutions is suggested to counterbalance the relatively high mixing enthalpies, thus enabling Au, Co and Ni to mix effectively. However, the significantly higher mixing enthalpies between Ag and Co, Cr and Ni of +19, +27 and +15kJ/mol, respectively, appear to be too high for the high mixing entropy to be effective in that case.","['fig6', 'fig6', 'fig1']",[]
3.4,Results.Au addition to AlCoCrCuNi alloy,"From the above discussions of the alloying behavior for Au or Ag in AlCoCrCuNi-based six element equimolar alloys, then it appears that the positive mixing enthalpy between the principal element pairs must be kept below a critical value of around 10kJ/mol in order to allow effective mixing of all the elements. With consideration to the Gibbs free energy relationship, given by Eq.(1), then it is readily seen that such a limit on the mixing enthalpy is dependent upon the mixing entropy. Assuming similar thermal characteristics of the present high-entropy alloys and previously studied AlxCoCrCuFeNi high-entropy alloys[7], then the temperature range for phase transformations and microstructural evolution can be considered to be between 1500 and 500°C, in which sufficient atomic diffusion can proceed. This infers that the observed microstructure evolves before the cast has cooled to 500°C. The configurational entropy of a six element equimolar random solution is given by ΔSm=Rln6=1.79R[3], whereRis the gas constant (8.314J/Kmol). The entropy contribution to the free energy of mixing (−TΔSm) at 1500, 1000 and 500°C is thus 26.4, 18.9 and 11.5kJ/mol, respectively. This rationalizes an observed maximum positive enthalpy of about 10kJ/mol in six element equimolar alloys, as the entropy contribution is sufficient to counterbalance it, thus allowing effective mixing between incompatible elements. Besides the entropy contribution, the strong bonding of Au–Al pairs (−22) also favor mixing between the six elements. This implies that aluminum can retain elements which are incompatible with gold, in the same way that gold can inhibit copper segregation.",[],[]
3.4,Results.Au addition to AlCoCrCuNi alloy,"By a similar analogy, one may consider the Gibbs free energy relationship for the well known binary Cu–Ni alloy which forms a continuous random solid solution over the whole composition range. Taking the equimolar composition 50% Cu–50% Ni for comparison, the mixing enthalpy of the Cu–Ni pair is +4kJ/mol[12]and the mixing entropy is ΔSm=Rln2=0.69R. Thus, the entropy contribution to free energy (−TΔSm) at 1500, 1000 and 500°C are 10.2, 7.3 and 4.4kJ/mol, respectively. In this case, as for the abovementioned high-entropy alloys, it can be seen that the mixing entropy is sufficient to counterbalance the positive mixing enthalpy and enable effective mixing between the incompatible elements.",[],[]
3.5,Results.Hardness," Table 2 shows the hardness of the present alloys. The similar hardness of the AlCoCrCuNi and AlCoCrCuFeNi alloys is considered to be a result of their similar microstructures, as well as a limited influence from solid solution hardening on account of the comparable size of Fe to most of the other elements present. The golden and silver layers of the AgAlCoCrCuNi alloy are noted to have the lowest and highest hardnesses in Table 2 , respectively. This is attributed to the Ag–Cu composition of the former, in addition to the Ag–Cu pair mixing enthalpy of +2kJ/mol[14]. The reduced copper content, due to its segregation to the golden layer, is considered to be the reason for the increased hardness of the silver layer compared to the base alloy. The small volume fraction of dispersed globular Ag–Cu phase does not appear to adversely affect the hardness. The reduced bonding strength, as a result of the positive mixing enthalpies of Au with Co and Ni, and the formation of a weaker FCC phase are considered the reasons for the reduced hardness of the Au containing alloy.",[],"['tbl2', 'tbl2']"
4,Conclusions,"The alloying behavior of any one principal element was found to be significantly affected by the other principal elements in high-entropy alloys. Only BCC and FCC solution phases were observed for the AlCoCrCuNi base alloy, which were associated to the multielement dendrite and copper-rich interdendrite regions, respectively. The relative proportion of the solution phases and microstructure of the base alloy were not found to change significantly with Fe addition. This resulted in these two alloys having similar hardnesses. The as-cast ingot formed two distinct layers as a result of silver addition. One layer had a hypoeutectic Ag–Cu composition, while the other consisted of the other principal elements, with, however, a reduced Cu content and virtually no Ag. The compositions of these two layers resulted in them having the lowest and highest hardnesses of the alloys studied, respectively. The formation of these two layers was ascribed to the chemical incompatibility, i.e. high positive enthalpies, between silver with the other elements. Contrary to silver, however, gold was found to mix well with the other five elements and also inhibited copper segregation. Thus, gold appeared to function as a mixing agent between copper and the other elements. The positive enthalpies of the Au–Co and Au–Ni atom pairs, in addition to its FCC structure were considered to account for the reduced hardness of the Au containing alloy compared to the other multiprincipal alloys. The results of the present equimolar alloy systems demonstrate the importance of the competition between the mixing enthalpy of the atom pairs and the mixing entropy. In order to achieve effective mixing in six element alloys it was determined that the maximum positive enthalpy between atom pairs should not exceed about 10kJ/mol. This demonstrates that the mutual interaction between elements, based on their mixing enthalpies, should be taken into account when designing high-entropy alloys.",[],[]
