0,Abstract,"The deformation behaviour of three direct laser fabricated AlxCoCrFeNi high entropy alloys were examined. One alloy had a face-centered cubic (x = 0.3) structure, one had a two-phase structure comprising an ordered (B2) and disordered BCC phase (x = 0.85), and the third alloy contained a mixture of all three phases (x = 0.6). The deformation behaviour of all three alloys was examined by mechanical testing, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The dislocation density of specimens was measured using x-ray diffraction. For the FCC alloy, it was found that the correlation between dislocation density, applied stress and compressive strain all benchmark closely with the behaviour of austenitic stainless steel. It is therefore found that this alloy does not show any unique deformation behaviours of note, and like austenitic steels, show a low yield point, moderately high work hardening rates and excellent plasticity. For the case of the alloy with a high aluminium concentration, which had a two-phase B2+BCC microstructure, an exceptionally high yield strength of 1400 MPa was observed. Nano-hardness examination of this alloy showed that the B2 phase had an exceptionally high hardness value. Since the alloy contained a large volume fraction of this hard intermetallic B2 phase, is was concluded that the B2 phase is responsible for the high strength of this alloy. It was shown that this alloy behaves like a composite, and its strength can be predicted closely using a simple rule of mixtures approach. The poor tensile ductility of BCC high entropy alloys has been suggested to be the result of the inability of the B2 phase to accommodate shape change, leading to interphase cracking that results in brittle fracture characteristics.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a relatively new concept of alloy design deriving their properties from five or more metallic constituent elements, with the concentration of each element being between 5 and 35 at.%[1–3]. Typically, a disordered solid solution structure is stabilised in these multicomponent alloys by the lowering of Gibbs free energy due to the high configurational entropy of mixing (ΔSconf)[1], low enthalpy of mixing and the chemical compatibility among the constituent elements[4,5]. However, in some cases ordered phases have been found to form[2]. The HEA class exhibits promising mechanical properties with strengths of up to 3 GPa being reported[6]. The AlxCoCrFeNi HEA system shows a unique combination of physical and mechanical properties, and has been chosen for further study in the present manuscript. Depending on the Al concentration, this system is known to have either a single phase FCC structure, or a duplex BCC structure comprising both a conventional disordered BCC (ferritic) phase in addition to a related superlattice structure of either L12or B2 crystal structure[7–9]. A combination of FCC, BCC and superlattice structures can also form[8–16].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The FCC alloys of the AlxCoCrFeNi system such as Al0.1CoCrFeNi[17]and Al0.3CoCrFeNi[18,19]show fairly low yield strengths of just a few hundred MPa, but show exceptionally high work hardening rates (WHR) which are very similar to TWIP steels[20]. The plasticity mechanisms in FCC HEA's have been well studied and it is known that deformation occurs by normal FCC slip on the {111} plane in the 〈110〉 direction[21,22]. It was shown in the literature that high strength can be achieved in FCC HEAs by grain refinement[23], dislocation hardening[19,24]and precipitation hardening[9]. However, the unusually high WHR is yet to be fully explored. Although we suggested in a previous paper that the high WHR was due to mechanical twinning[18], the precise mechanism is yet to be examined in detail. Work hardening is a balance between the accumulation of dislocations and their concurrent annihilation by dynamic recovery. It is not yet clear if this process of dynamic recovery is retarded in HEA's – this may be the key to their high WHR's. This is one of the aspects of HEA deformation behaviour studied in the present work.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In stark contrast to the mechanical behaviour of the FCC low-aluminium alloys, those alloys from the AlxCoCrFeNi family with high Al concentrations show extremely high yield strengths of up to 1400 MPa, but very poor ductilities[25,26]. This transition has been suggested in literature[27,28]to be the result of the formation of hard B2 phase (ordered BCC phase enriched in Ni- and Al-) in the BCC alloys, but this has not been studied in detail. It remains unclear why two very similar HEA's, one with a FCC structure and one with a BCC structure would show such markedly different properties. The micro-composite effect associated with the BCC/B2 microstructure may be one of the reasons for both the high strength and low ductility, but the distribution of strain within the different phases has not before been studied, and is therefore not yet understood. The plastic deformation mechanisms of the BCC alloys have not been treated in any detail, and may be more complex than the FCC case suggests. The deformation behaviour of the B2 phase formed in the BCC alloys is not entirely clear, there seems to be consensus that NiAl deforms by slip on the {011} plane, but the direction of slip could be either 〈111〉 or 〈100〉[29–32]. In the present case it may be that the B2 phase do not plastically deform at all, and simply act as rigid particles which are bypassed by dislocations by Orowan bowing. Clearly, we must examine this in more detail before we can understand the transition in behaviour of these alloys as a function of Al concentration. In this manuscript the plastic deformation behaviour and strength-ductility combinations of the AlxCoCrFeNi family with a range of Al concentrations and phase distributions is studied, with particular emphasis on a high-aluminium BCC HEAs.",[],[]
2,Materials and methods,"The compressive and tensile properties of three selected alloys were compared: FCC- Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy (Al0.3), dual phase- Al0.6CoCrFeNi alloy (Al0.6) and BCC- Al0.85CoCrFeNi alloy (Al0.85) containing B2 phase. These HEAs were fabricated using a TRUMPF TruLaser Cell 7040 direct laser fabrication (DLF) apparatus from spherical gas-atomized powders of Co, Cr, Fe, Ni and Al as discussed elsewhere[27]. Columns were built with a cross-section of 15 × 15 mm2and 100 mm in length. The bulk chemical composition of the HEA samples determined by glow discharge optical emission spectroscopy (LECO GDS 850A) are detailed inTable 1, and showed good agreement with the target compositions.",[],['tbl1']
2,Materials and methods,"X-ray diffraction (XRD) was used to measure the volume fraction of constituent phases and also to examine the dislocation density of selected specimens. Specimens were metallographically prepared by conventional grinding and polishing techniques, followed by a final polishing step with colloidal silica. XRD was carried out on a Bruker D8 Advance with Cu Kα radiation, a Lynxeye-XE energy discriminating line detector and line focus optics. The volume fraction of phases were calculated using the fitting software TOPAS version 5. Instrumental broadening was measured using a NIST standard LaB6specimen, and microstrain was also calculated using TOPAS. Microstrain was converted to dislocation density (ρ) using the relationship given in equation(1)[33].(1)ρ=kε02/b2ρ = dislocation densityεo= microstrain measured by XRDb = Burgers vector, estimated from the lattice parameter measured in XRDk = 16.1 for FCC and 14.4 for BCC structures",['fd1'],[]

2,Materials and methods,"The microstructural characterisation of the samples were performed using a Zeiss Supra 55VP scanning electron microscope at an operating voltage of 20 kV. Thin foils for TEM analysis were prepared from the bulk specimens, were thinned to electron transparency by ion milling using GATAN precision ion polishing system. TEM investigations were conducted using a JOEL 2100 LaB6transmission electron microscope at an operating voltage of 200 kV, coupled with a Gatan Orius SC100 high resolution camera.",[],[]
2,Materials and methods,"The specimens for mechanical testing were wire electrical discharge machined from the DLF ingots and these samples were polished with 1200 and 4000 grit size emery papers prior to testing. Care was taken to ensure the loading direction of the test specimens to be parallel to the building direction (solidification direction). The compression testing of samples with 8 mm diameter and a length of 12 mm were performed using a Servotest Thermo Mechanical Test Simulator (TMTS-500 kN). Compression samples were covered with Teflon tape, and graphite spray was then applied to the tool steel platens in order to reduce friction during compression testing. Tensile tests were performed using an Instron 100 kN tensile machine on specimens with a gage length, gage width and thickness of 16 mm, 4 mm and 2 mm respectively. Three tests per alloy were performed at an initial strain rate of 1 × 10−3s−1under tensile and compressive loading and all the mechanical tests were stopped at a true strain of 1.0, unless the failure had not already occurred. Since the BCC alloys were known contain B2 structured particles, the hardness of the individual constituents were evaluated using nano-indentation in a UMIS 2000 Nano-indentation apparatus equipped with a Berkovich indenter. The test was conducted at a very small load of 5 mN, so that the indentation would be constrained to the particles and the indents were made in a grid (20*20) with a spacing of 10 μm between each indent.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Phase and microstructure,"X-ray diffraction spectra of the three selected alloys produced by DLF were shown in our previous publication[27]and is replotted and shown inFig. 1. The XRD pattern of Al0.3alloy showed it to be a single phase FCC structure and a strong (200)FCCdiffraction peak was observed. The DLF Al0.6sample exhibited diffraction peaks corresponding to both FCC and BCC phases. The Al0.85alloy showed diffraction peaks corresponding to the BCC phase, with a strong (200)BCCdiffraction peak. The presence of a (100)BCCdiffraction peak at ∼30° indicates the presence of an ordered BCC phase in the Al0.6and Al0.85alloy with a B2 crystal structure (space groupPm-3m and an approximate lattice parameter of 2.88 Å) [Powder diffraction file 04-012-6340]. This phase is commonly associated with the intermetallic compound NiAl.",['fig1'],[]
3.1,Results.Phase and microstructure,"The microstructures of as-deposited FCC Al0.3alloy showed a columnar grain structure longitudinal to the build direction, and showed an average length of 1250 μm (Fig. 2(a)) and an average width of 200 μm across the transverse directionFig. 2(b) without any significant elemental segregation in the FCC matrix of the alloyFig. 2(c). The DLF Al0.6CoCrFeNi alloy had Widmanstätten plates grow inside grains that are equi-axed in shape, and have an average size of 250 μm along longitudinal (Fig. 2(d)) and transverse direction (Fig. 2(e)), similar to the Widmanstätten structure observed in steels[34]. The FCC Widmanstätten plates (volume fraction 63%) were mostly separated by B2 phase and in some regions by a duplex BCC (B2+disordered BCC) structure (Fig. 2(f)). As discussed in our previous publication[27], the B2 phase of the alloy was enriched in Ni and Al (volume fraction 30%) and the disordered BCC phase with net shaped morphology (volume fraction 7%) was enriched in Fe and Cr. The DLF Al0.85CoCrFeNi alloy exhibited a columnar grain structure longitudinal to the solidification direction with an average length of 800 μm (Fig. 2(g)) and a width of 200 μm (Fig. 2(h)) along the transverse direction. The SEM analysis showed the presence of two phases (Fig. 2(i)): B2 phase enriched in Ni and Al (volume fraction 48%) and a disordered BCC phase enriched in Fe and Cr (volume fraction 52%). The volume fraction of the constituent phases of the HEAs are summarised inFig. 3.","['fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig3']",[]
3.2.1,Results.Mechanical properties of HEAs.Nano-hardness testing,"The three HEAs examined here showed FCC, BCC, and B2 phases in their microstructures. Since the size of most of the second phase particles in the HEAs were very fine (refer back toFig. 2), the mechanical properties of the constituent phases were measured using nanohardness testing. Typical examples of the load-displacement curves and corresponding indentations for the Al0.85alloy are shown inFig. 4. It can be seen that the phase that appears darker in the SEM, which is enriched in Ni and Al, is significantly harder than the other phase. A Gaussian curve was fitted to the histogram of the nano-hardness data to extract statistically robust values for each of the phases. This was straight forward procedure for the FCC alloy, but was complicated for the BCC alloy due to the overlap of indents into regions containing both phases. In this case three peaks were fitted, one for each phase and another in between to account for the indents that represent a mixture response from the two phases,Fig. 4(d). All results are summarised inTable 2.","['fig2', 'fig4', 'fig4']",['tbl2']
3.2.2,Results.Mechanical properties of HEAs.Tension and compression testing,"The flow curves from tension and compression of the single phase FCC Al0.3alloy in the as-deposited condition are shown inFig. 5(a), and it is clear that the tension and compression data show similar yield strengths (194 MPa) in tension and compression. In compression, the Al0.3alloy exhibited a sustained work hardening rate for the duration of the test, and showed excellent compressive ductility. However, in tension the alloy showed minimal work hardening with a serrated flow behaviour and a tensile ductility of 0.38.",['fig5'],[]
3.2.2,Results.Mechanical properties of HEAs.Tension and compression testing,"The Al0.6alloy (that had a Widmanstätten structure) exhibited a slightly higher yield strength than the low Al concentration FCC alloy. However, for this alloy the strain to failure and work hardening behaviour were superior in compressive loading compared to a tensile loading,Fig. 5(b). The other difference in properties due to the loading orientation was in the compressive strength which was 1420 MPa in compression compared to 930 MPa in tension. Similar to the Al0.3alloy, the Al0.6alloy also showed flow serrations under tensile loading.",['fig5'],[]
3.2.2,Results.Mechanical properties of HEAs.Tension and compression testing,"The Al0.85alloy with BCC structure exhibited perfect brittle fracture with no signs of plasticity under tensile loading,Fig. 5(c). However, in compression this alloy showed a high yield strength of 1400 MPa, ultimate strength of 2250 MPa and reasonably good true strain to failure of 0.25 under compressive loading.",['fig5'],[]
3.3,Results.Deformed microstructure of Al0.3FCC alloy,"A detailed analysis of the deformed microstructure of the Al0.3alloy was discussed elsewhere[18]and will not be repeated here in detail. However, the main feature of interest in this case is the observation of deformation twins in compression but not in tension,Fig. 6. The SEM-EBSD map of compression deformed microstructure of the Al0.3alloy after a true strain of 1.0 showed extensive twinning (Fig. 6(a)). The presence of very fine mechanical twins (Fig. 6(b)) as the dominant deformation mechanism provided a steady source of strain hardening and an additional deformation mode to accommodate the imposed strain, similar to TWIP steels[20]. In tension, however, EBSD analysis showed no indication of twinning in the sample at a true strain to failure of 0.38,Fig. 6(c) and was deformed by slip,Fig. 6(d).","['fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6']",[]
3.3,Results.Deformed microstructure of Al0.3FCC alloy,"The tensile deformed samples of the Al0.3and Al0.6samples showed flow serrations. The serration behaviours of several HEAs from cryogenic to elevated temperatures was reported in the literature[35]. In a previous publication we suggested that these were the result of either dynamic strain ageing or the propagation of longitudinal cracks along the grain boundaries[18]. In the present case it is more likely that the serrations are from crack propagation rather than DSA because DSA is known to be associated with an increase in the work hardening rate, rather than a decrease[36].",[],[]
3.4,Results.Deformed microstructure of Al0.6FCC BCC alloy,"A typical example of the microstructure observed after compression of the Al0.6alloy is shown inFig. 7(a). The B2 phase was also observed to undergo extensive deformation under compressive loading,Fig. 7. EBSD map (Fig. 7(c–d)) showed that the FCC grains in this alloy also exhibited deformation twinning in response to compressive stress. This was confirmed by TEM,Fig. 7(b).","['fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7']",[]
3.4,Results.Deformed microstructure of Al0.6FCC BCC alloy,"The macrostructure of the tensile deformed Al0.6alloy is shown inFig. 8(a). Microstructural examination behind the tensile fracture surface showed the formation of cracks and voids, and these were commonly associated with the FCC/BCC interface,Fig. 8(b). The tensile specimen of Al0.6alloy showed a mixed fracture behaviour comprising regions of both a dimpled appearance of a ductile fracture surface, and a faceted appearance of a brittle fracture surface,Fig. 8(c). The FCC grains in this alloy showed deformation twinning in the tensile sample after a true strain of 0.27, as evident from the EBSD map (Fig. 8(d–e)).","['fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8']",[]
3.4,Results.Deformed microstructure of Al0.6FCC BCC alloy,"The multi-phase structured Al0.6HEA showed a good combination of strength and ductility and is due to the formation of hard B2 phase with increasing aluminium concentration compared to Al0.3HEA, without causing serious embrittlement. Previous work on the tensile deformed Al0.6HEA[37]showed that FCC phase yielded prior to the B2 phase, and the B2 phase accommodates more stress partition during the plastic deformation stage despite its low volume fraction. It is worth noting that the tensile strength of Al0.6and Al0.85alloys were similar and may correspond to the tensile rupture strength of the B2 phase present in both HEAs (Fig. 5). However, it was shown in our previous publication that the strength and WHR's of the Al0.6HEA during compressive loading was determined by the distribution and morphology of the constituent phases[27].",['fig5'],[]
3.5,Results.Deformed microstructure of Al0.85BCC alloy,"The tensile deformed sample of the Al0.85alloy showed limited ductility,Fig. 5(c), and the fracture occurred normal to the tensile axis (Fig. 9(a–b)). Secondary cracks were also observed behind the fracture surface, and these had a tendency to follow the interphase boundaries of the BCC and B2 phases,Fig. 9(c). The tensile fracture surface of the Al0.85alloy is shown inFig. 9(d) and it can be seen that the surface shows the classical characteristics of brittle fracture. A selected sample was pre-polished before deformation allowing slip lines to be observed on the surface after a compressive true strain of 0.2. Despite the high volume fraction of fine second phase particles, the slip traces of this sample were relatively flat, and did not appear to deviate in between or around the particles (Fig. 9(e)).","['fig5', 'fig9', 'fig9', 'fig9', 'fig9']",[]
3.5,Results.Deformed microstructure of Al0.85BCC alloy,"The Al0.85alloy has a complex structure containing significant portions of the ordered B2 phase. Consequently a slip trace analysis[38]was carried out to examine the slip system activity. The slip traces were analysed using the following method. The sample surface was metallographically polished to a mirror finish. The sample was then compressed to a true strain of 0.05 (optical micrograph shown inFig. 10(a)), and care was taken in protecting the sample from external contacts. The compressed specimen was then ultrasonically cleaned in ethanol and mounted on a stub for SEM analysis. The crystallographic orientation of the individual grains was measured using EBSD (Fig. 10(b)). The same area was imaged outside of the SEM using an optical microscope because the SEM can cause a rotation or distortion of the image, particularly during tilt correction for EBSD.","['fig10', 'fig10']",[]
3.5,Results.Deformed microstructure of Al0.85BCC alloy,"Slip traces were compared to the grain orientation to determine the most likely slip system responsible for that trace,Fig. 11. The two possible slip systems were considered: {110} and {112} as these two planes are known to be active in BCC alloys[39,40]. The flat surface became roughened after compression testing and identification of slip systems were confined to grains were slip lines were clearly distinct and EBSD indexing was possible. Out of the 32 sets of slip traces examined, 16 sets of slip traces corresponded to slip on the {110} plane (as shown inFig. 11(a)) and 10 sets corresponded to slip on the {112} plane (as shown inFig. 11(b)). The remaining set of slip traces were ambiguous and differentiation between the {110} and {112} planes could not be distinguished. Thus it can be concluded that slip on both the {110} and {112} planes is possible in the present alloy. It is noted here that the slip direction cannot not be determined using the slip trace technique, only the slip plane. However, the slip direction of BCC HEAs in the literature were reported to be 〈111〉 direction similar to BCC metals[41]. Zou et al.[42]studied a NbMoTaW BCC HEA by micro-compression, and suggested that the most probable slip plane in their case was the {112} plane. Theoretical studies using ab initio[43]and experimental[41]techniques do not explicitly state which slip system is most likely to occur. Therefore both the experimental results obtained here and a review of the literature currently available suggests that slip on both the {110} and {112} planes is possible in BCC HEA alloys.","['fig11', 'fig11', 'fig11']",[]
3.6,Results.XRD of deformed microstructures,"XRD was used to estimate the dislocation density of two selected alloys, the FCC Al0.3alloy and the BCC Al0.85alloy. Samples were deformed to various strains in compression, and then measured to determine the micro-strain. The dislocation density calculation requires a knowledge of the crystal structure and Burgers vector, and for the case of the BCC alloy, we have determined this to be slip on the {110} plane (see section3.5). From the literature, we know that the FCC HEA shows slip in the {111} plane[21,22]. The results of the dislocation density analysis are shown inFig. 12. It can be seen that the dislocation density increases with strain in both alloys. However, it is apparent that the BCC alloy in the as-built condition had a higher dislocation density than the FCC alloy before deformation. It can also be seen that the increase in dislocation density as a function of strain is higher for the BCC alloy.",['fig12'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Strengthening model,"It is commonly found in metallurgical systems that the strength of an alloy is directly proportional to the dislocation density, and that this is a first order effect[44,45].Fig. 13shows the dislocation density data plotted according to strength rather than plastic strain for the FCC alloy. Also on this plot is data for three different austenitic stainless steels subject to cold rolling by S.K. Paul et al. [Unpublished]. It can be seen that there is excellent agreement between the three steels and the Al0.3HEA examined here. It was shown in the literature that the effect of solid solution hardening is too small to account for the strength difference in FCC HEAs[9,22]. It can therefore be concluded that the FCC HEA alloy deforms in a manner consistent with other FCC alloys, and that is does not show any particularly unique behaviours in this regard. This is consistent with the very similar flow stress curves shown by TWIP steels and the present FCC alloy,Fig. 13.","['fig13', 'fig13']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Strengthening model,"Looking now to the BCC alloy, for a given dislocation density this alloy shows a higher strength level than the FCC alloy. There must therefore be an additional strengthening mechanism in this alloy. This was further interrogated using the nano-hardness data which examines the strength of the individual constituents of the alloy,Table 2. Yield strength data for a fully martensitic steel, and a fully ferritic steel have been used to determine a scaling factor for converting the hardness to an approximate strength level,Fig. 14. Using a simple rule of mixtures, the strength of the BCC alloy was estimated assuming that the B2 and BCC phases were approximately equal volume fractions (Fig. 3). Using this relationship, it was found that the strength of the alloy is estimated to be 1300 MPa, seeTable 3. There is quite good agreement between the estimated yield strength and the measured yield strength of 1400 MPa. It can therefore be concluded that the strength of the BCC HEA can be estimated by a simple rule of mixtures, and that the large increase in strength of the BCC alloy compared to the FCC case is the development of a large volume fraction of hard B2 phase which results from A1 addition. The B2 phase was measured to have a strength of 9.1 GPa by nano-hardness, and this equates to an approximate yield strength of 1700 MPa. A recent publication by Linden et al.[46]showed the importance of domain boundaries of the B2 phase of AlCoCrFeNi alloy on the mechanical properties and strain distribution across the constituent phases and might be the reason for the deviation of the mechanical properties from the experimentally observed values in the proposed model.","['fig14', 'fig3']","['tbl2', 'tbl3']"
4.2,Discussion.Brittle fracture in tension for the BCC alloy,"The Al0.85alloy, which contained a composite structure of BCC and B2 phases, showed a strain to failure of 0.245 under compressive loading, but showed negligible tensile ductility. The poor interfacial strength between phases is likely to be the reason for the observed brittleness in tension. This is evidenced by the observation of secondary cracks along the interphase boundaries,Fig. 10(c). This is consistent with literature reports on similar alloys from the spinodal family which also show limited room temperature tensile ductility[47–49]. Moreover, composite systems such as the Ti- and Zr- based bulk metallic glasses[50], and the Ni-Fe-Al alloy which contains the B2 phase[51]also exhibit similar levels of tension-compression asymmetry in strength and ductility as that of the Al0.85alloy found in the present work. The deformation and fracture behaviour of NiAl is relatively well studied e.g. Ref.[52], and it is known that the B2 phase lacks the five independent slip systems required to accommodate shape change through slip. In single phase B2 alloys this leads to strain incompatibility at the grain boundaries, and this leads to premature grain boundary fracture. In the present case, it is likely that the inability of the B2 phase to accommodate shape change will cause strain concentrations at the interface between phases. This will likely lead to the formation of cracks at the interphase boundaries, and result in the observed brittle fracture. The hypothesis on a universal fracture criterion for high-strength materials[53]may also accounts for the difference in ductility observed for the Al0.85alloy in tension and compression.",['fig10'],[]
5,Conclusions,"The deformation mechanisms of additively manufactured FCC, FCC + BCC and BCC HEAs of the AlxCoCrFeNi alloy system under tensile and compressive loading were studied leading to the following key insights:➢The FCC Al0.3alloy showed a yield strength of 194 MPa in tension and compression. The alloy displayed a high work hardening rate in compression and this was correlated with an increase in the dislocation density with strain. Benchmarking the compressive strength against three austenitic steel alloys showed that this HEA deforms in a manner consistent with conventional FCC alloys. No unique deformation behaviours were observed. The unusually poor tensile behaviour of this as-deposited alloy has been attributed to longitudinal cracking within the gauge length. This resulted in poor ductility and serrated flow curves.➢The BCC Al0.85alloy was composed of approximately equal volumes of disordered BCC phase and an ordered B2 phase. Slip line analysis confirmed that the alloy deforms by slip on the {110} planes. This alloy exhibited a very high yield strength of 1400 MPa, and showed reasonably good strain to failure under compressive loading. Investigation of the strength of the individual phases by nano-hardness measurements indicated that the macroscopic yield strength of the alloy could be explained by a simple rule of mixtures whereby the addition of a large fraction of hard B2 phase increased the strength of the duplex alloy. No other hardening mechanisms such as precipitate strengthening were found to be operative.➢The brittle fracture of the BCC alloy under tensile loading has been ascribed to the high volume fraction of the B2 phase, which is known to be a brittle phase that lacks the ability to accommodate shape change. This imparts the material with brittle fracture characteristics in tension.➢The FCC/BCC Al0.6alloy showed a yield strength of 400 MPa and exhibited a mixed fracture behaviour with brittle fracture in the BCC phase and dimple/ductile fracture in the FCC phase. The reduced ductility of the alloy in tensile loading might be attributed to crack growth along the interphase boundaries, compared to compressive loading where crack propagation is slowed.",[],[]
