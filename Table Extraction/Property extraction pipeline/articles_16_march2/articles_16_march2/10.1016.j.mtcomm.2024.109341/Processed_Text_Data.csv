0,Abstract,"High- and medium-entropy alloys have emerged as promising materials with significant potential for diverse technical applications. Notably, their use in the field of energy technology has attracted particular interest, where thermophysical properties play a pivotal role. In this context, this study aims to investigate the thermophysical properties, namely thermal expansion behavior, thermal diffusivity, specific heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and the electric resistivity of single-phase face-centered cubic alloys between 300 K and 773 K. In addition to thermal conductivity, the electric resistivity was measured. Based on the Wiedemann-Franz law, electronic and phononic contributions to the overall thermal conductivity were evaluated. Complementary insights into the electronic state of the investigated materials were obtained by electron spin resonance measurements, revealing the presence of short-range ordering in all alloys. The specific heat capacity is found to dominate the thermal conductivity. Furthermore, the study shows the decisive influence of chemical complexity on the thermophysical properties. Notably, the observed influences extend to the electronic thermal conductivity, pointing out the correlation between composition and heat transport properties. This comprehensive investigation provides a foundation for understanding and tailoring the thermophysical behavior of the studied alloys, offering valuable insights for their targeted deployment in advanced energy applications.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The design and in-depth exploration of multifunctional materials based on the metallic d‑block elements represent an advancing field within materials science. Among the various multicomponent systems, so-called compositionally complex alloys (CCAs) are currently acknowledged as a promising category of functional or structural materials[1–4]. In comparison with conventional alloys, CCAs break down the traditional notions, since they consist of two to four principal elements (Medium Entropy Alloys – MEA) or five or more elements (High Entropy Alloys – HEA) in near-equiatomic configuration[5,6]and are currently recognized as a promising category of functional and/or structural materials. These materials exhibit substantial potential and exceptional performance in terms of mechanical properties[7–13], electronic applications[14,15], corrosion resistance[16–19], and irradiation resistance[20,21]. Furthermore, HEAs and MEAs show high potential for applications in renewable energy[22]and energy storage, like hydrogen retention[23,24]or oxygen evolution and reduction[25].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The equiatomic single-phase fcc CrMnFeCoNi HEA, commonly known as the 'Cantor alloy'[1]and its derived variants are often acknowledged as suitable single-phase model systems due to their different high-entropy effects resulting from their chemical complexity and are thus frequently proposed for these use cases. An important feature of this innovative class of alloys is its ability to offer new ways of tailoring material properties by manipulating compositional complexity. This involves alterations in the variety and concentration of elements[12]. In addition, it not only expands the conventional concept of alloying and microstructure modification but also presents challenges in understanding physical properties and the potential for tuning them. The extensive potential of these alloys underlines therefore the desirability of acquiring knowledge regarding their thermophysical properties in a broad temperature range. This is particularly noteworthy considering the abundance of literature on the mechanical properties, creating a knowledge gap regarding the thermophysical characteristics.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The thermophysical properties of HEAs, including thermal conductivity, specific heat capacity, density, thermal diffusivity and coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) as well as the resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient, are pivotal in understanding their behavior under diverse temperature conditions in applications like catalysis[26]or energy conversion[27]. The knowledge about the influences on these specific properties is the key to optimizing HEAs for specific applications, from advanced engineering materials to sustainable energy solutions. Moreover, the study of their thermophysical properties challenges our fundamental understanding of materials science, providing insights into the intricate interplay between composition, microstructure, and physical properties. Within the last decade, relevant contributions have been made byJin et al.[28,29], who used experimental and first-principle approaches to determine the thermophysical properties of Ni-containing HEAs and MEAs. They found that the influence of Cr is critical and dramatically reduces the thermal conductivity of the alloys, while other studies focused mainly on the influence of Al in these alloys[30]. When it comes to thermophysical properties, the influence of electrons and short-range ordering (SRO) may be significant, as suggested by first-principle simulations[28,29]. However, the experimental verification of the electronic state, which is predominant for the determination of thermophysical properties, remains elusive. In previous works, measurements of the electronic state have primarily been performed using conduction electron spin resonance (CESR), a method that can be used to determine the quantity of free electrons[31–33]. Additionally, the effects of atomic ordering and bonding are measurable within this principle. This approach was particularly focused on steels and is extended in the present study to encompass HEAs and MEAs. To sum up, the here presented experimental study focuses on both the measurement of thermophysical properties between 300 K and 773 K and the determination of the electronic state of HEAs and MEAs.",[],[]
2.1,Methods.Materials preparation and heat treatment,"Equiatomic and single-phase fcc alloys including CrMnFeCoNi, CrFeCoNi, CrCoNi and CrFeNi were produced from high-purity raw elements (≥ 99.9 wt%). The latter were vacuum induction melted under a protective Ar atmosphere as 2.1 kg ingots using a Leybold Heraeus IS 1/III vacuum induction furnace, poured into a cylindrical steel mold (45 mm diameter, 160 mm height), and cooled to 300 K as described in one of our previous studies[34]. Subsequently, the cast ingots underwent turning on a lathe, reducing their diameter to 40 mm, after which they were cut into two equal halves (each 80 mm in height) perpendicular to the rod axis. The cast ingots were homogenized at 1473 K for 48 hours in evacuated fused silica tubes (3 × 10-5mbar), cold worked by rotary swaging at 300 K with a diameter reduction of ∼60% using a four-die rotary swaging machine (HMP R6–4–120–21S, HMP Umformtechnik GmbH), and recrystallized at 1100°C for 30 min, see Ref.[35]for more details.",[],[]

Backscattered electron (BSE) micrographs were employed using a MIRA3 SEM by TESCAN ORSAY HOLDING, a. s. Grain size analysis was conducted using four BSE micrographs taken at various locations spaced several millimeters apart, spanning from the center to the outer surface of the recrystallized rods. The Heyn linear intercept method was employed to determine the average grain size. Eight lines of equal length were superimposed on each micrograph, in line with the guidelines outlined in ASTM E-112[37]. Each line was required to intersect a minimum of 50 grains, resulting in a substantial number of intercepts, typically ranging from 500 to 1000 per micrograph. To calculate the average grain size, four independent measurements were carried out, and the error bars reflect the mean deviation from the calculated mean value.",[],[]

2.3.1,Methods.Thermophysical properties.Thermal conductivity,"Density measurements were conducted at room temperature (RT) using Archimedes' principle. These measurements were carried out in both air and ethanol using a high-precision laboratory balance CPA 225D by Sartorius AG. To establish density for all three samples, five measurements of each alloy were performed to determine the average and estimate the mean deviation from the mean value. The temperature dependence of the density was assessed in conjunction with the coefficient of thermal expansion (αth) using a vertical dilatometer with an Al2O3differential measurement system (type L75 Platinum Series) by Linseis Messgeraete GmbH. Round samples, each with a diameter of 4 mm and a length of 20 mm, were employed for dilatometry. Reference parameters included the room temperature and the length of the sample at room temperature.

The samples, featuring a diameter of 10 mm and a thickness (L) of 2 mm, were ground using 1000 mesh SiC paper and coated with a thin graphite layer to enhance laser radiation absorption, ensuring precise measurements. Throughout the laser irradiation, an infrared sensor continuously monitored the temperature of the sample’s upper surface. From the duration (t1/2), required for the upper side of the specimen to reach 50% of its maximum temperature, the thermal diffusivity was estimated usingEq. (2)[41]:(2)a= 1.38·L2/(π2·t1/2)",[],[]

2.3.1,Methods.Thermophysical properties.Thermal conductivity,"The specific isobar heat capacitycpwas determined using a Linseis Messgeraete GmbH HDSC PT-1600 differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) according to ASTM E1269[42]. The procedure involved stabilizing the calorimeter, followed by the measurement of two empty crucibles to establish baseline corrections. Subsequently, calibration was performed using a sapphire specimen in one crucible. To ensure efficient heat transfer between the specimens and crucibles, the samples with a diameter of 4 mm and a thickness of 0.5 mm were ground with a 1000-mesh SiC paper. The prepared samples replaced the sapphire after calibration. The heating process remained consistent throughout baseline, calibration, and sample measurements, comprising a linear heating rate of 20 K/min from 300 K up to 773 K, a 1-minute dwell time, and subsequent cooling to RT.

2.3.2,Methods.Thermophysical properties.Electrical resistivity,"To measure the electric resistivity and the Seebeck coefficient, the four-wire measuring method with an LSR-3 system from Linseis Messgeraete GmbH was employed. Cylindrical samples, 4 mm in diameter and 10 mm in length, were utilized for these tests. A thermal gradient of 50 K was applied using a secondary heating source located at the bottom of the sample. A probe current of 100 mA was introduced. Three independent measurements on three distinct specimens for each material and temperature were carried out. The average values and standard deviations were subsequently calculated.",[],[]
2.3.2,Methods.Thermophysical properties.Electrical resistivity,"By measuring the electrical resistance, a more detailed insight into the thermophysical properties can be achieved. This arises from the transport mechanisms of heat conduction in metallic materials. Following, the thermal conductivity in metallic materials is composed of several components, including a phononic contribution (λphononic) arising from lattice vibrations, an electronic (λelectronic) and a magnonic contribution (λmagnonic) resulting from electronic heat transfer[39,43,44]. As described in Ref.[44], the magnonic contribution is negligible and the thermal conductivity (λ) can be calculated using:(3)λ=λelectronic+λphononic",[],[]

As the thermal diffusivity (λ) and electronic contribution (λelectronic) can be determined usingEqs. (1) and (4), respectively, the phononic contribution (λphononic) can be deduced fromEq. (3).",[],[]
2.4,Methods.Electron spin resonance,"The experimental investigation of the electronic structure employed electron spin resonance (ESR). This technique provides crucial insights into electron properties in paramagnetic alloys, specifically revealing the existence of different electron subsystems and the impact of solutes on the electron state density at the Fermi surface (D(EF)). In particular, the high sensitivity of the gyromagnetic factor (g-factor) to the inhomogeneity of the electron system forms the basis of this method. Theg-factor describes the quotient of the measured magnetic moment and the predicted moment, therefore giving information about the electronic spins. Through the magnetic susceptibility, ESR enables the exploration of interactions between free and localized electrons, yielding quantitative data on isolated localized d-electrons (single substitutional d solute atoms) and superparamagnetic clusters (clusters of d atoms).",[],[]
2.4,Methods.Electron spin resonance,"ESR measurements were carried out at 300 K. An Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectrometer Radiopan X-2244 was employed with a frequency (ν) of 9.3 GHz, microwave field power (Pmw) of ∼2 mW, the modulating field with modulation amplitude (Hm) of 3×10−1mT, and modulation frequency (f) of 100 kHz. The sample thickness of 20 µm ensured negligible skin effect at temperatures exceeding 100 K.",[],[]
2.4,Methods.Electron spin resonance,"Measurements were conducted using two set-up geometries, i.e., with an external magnetic field (H0) in the sample plane (θ= 0°) and withH0orthogonal to the sample plane (θ= 90°). This approach facilitated the exploration ofg-factor anisotropy, a sensitive tool for identifying phase transitions. The CESR signal was recorded as a derivative of absorbed microwave power on the external magnetic field, with MgO: Cr3+(g= 1.9799, number of spinsN= 3×1014) serving as the reference. To avoid artifacts during the CESR signal registration, the absorption signal of the microwave power from the empty resonator was recorded before each measurement. The theoretical evaluation of this technique can be found in Refs.[31,33].",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Composition and microstructure,"Before considering the thermophysical properties of the investigated materials, one has to consider their microstructure and chemical composition to exclude or quantify unintended influences. The chemical composition of the four investigated high-entropy alloys is found to be close to the targeted equiatomic composition ( Table 1 ). Moreover, the impurity concentrations (e.g., O and N) are relatively low (e.g., < 0.2 at% O and < 0.004 at% N). This lies within good agreement with the measured values in one of the previous studies, where the chemical composition has been investigated by X-ray fluorescence analysis and a similar manufacturing method was applied[46,47], indicating that our processing route is reproducible. More importantly, any significant influence of O and N on thermophysical properties is not expected, owing to their relatively low concentrations.",[],['tbl0005']
3.1,Results and discussion.Composition and microstructure,"Representative XRD patterns in Fig. 1 suggest that the four alloys are single-phase fcc, which can be validated based on the position of the diffraction peaks and their microstructure shown in the BSE images. Due to the lattice-preferred direction, the {111} signal exhibits a higher intensity than the {200} and {220} signals, which might be an artefact from swaging[34,48]. Corresponding lattice parameters obtained from the XRD patterns are shown in Table 2 , with the experimental error being at most ± 0.1%. Due to the manufacturing method and heat treatment, no significant segregation of the elements is expected, as shown in Ref.[34,46].",['fig0005'],['tbl0010']
3.1,Results and discussion.Composition and microstructure,"Since grain boundaries act as scattering sites for both phonons and electrons[49,50], grain size measurements were conducted as described inSection 2.2. The results are given in Table 2 . On such a large scale, the effect of grain boundaries on the thermophysical properties, however, can be neglected[51,52].",[],['tbl0010']
3.2.1,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Density,"The temperature-dependent density of the investigated alloys is displayed in Fig. 2 a. As the density is a parameter dependent on both weight and length, it is determined by the corresponding elements and their (atom-) weight as well as the lattice parameter. The lattice parameters are shown in Table 2 and show similar values for all the investigated alloys, which fit well with the lattice parameters from previous studies[34,46]. Additionally, these values strongly correlate with presented lattice parameters byJ. Coreño Alonso and O. Coreño Alonso[53], who derived lattice parameters of various HEA and MEA by volume size factors and Vegard’s law[54]. Accordingly, as the lattice parameters of the four alloys do not differ by more than 1% ( Table 2 ), the differences in density at RT can be attributed to variations in the atomic weights of the constituent elements. For instance, as the atomic weights of the elements are 51.996 (Cr), 54.938 (Mn), 55.845 (Fe), 58.933 (Co), and 58.693 (Ni)[55], large Ni and Co contents result in denser alloys. For this reason, CrCoNi has the highest density. CrFeNi and CrMnFeCoNi exhibit a similar density because Mn and Co have low and high atomic weights, respectively, thereby canceling each other out.",['fig0010'],"['tbl0010', 'tbl0010']"
3.2.1,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Density,"When considering the temperature dependence of density, only minor differences are observed. This is a result of similar coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE, exemplary shown in Table 3 ). Comparable values were also reported in the literature[29,46,56].",[],['tbl0015']
3.2.2,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Specific heat capacity,"The measured specific heat capacity of the investigated alloys is found to increase with temperature. The slopes of thecp(T)-curves are similar forT< 550 K in the four alloys, but CrFeCoNi exhibits a reduced slope at higher temperatures (see Fig. 2 b), indicating an exothermic reaction. However, as no sharp peaks are observed in Fig. 2 b and the subsequent XRD pattern after DSC measurements show no influence of the measurement temperatures, this suggests that no phase transformation, neither magnetic nor structural, takes place in the investigated temperature range[28,29,57]. This correlates well with the previous results reported in the literature, where the Curie temperatures (TC) for the alloys shown here are below 300 K, whereby the exact value is closely correlated to the Cr content of the alloys[28,29,57]. Nevertheless, it can be stated that increased chemical complexity leads to a higher specific heat capacity. This goes hand in hand with the analysis regarding thermal conductivity made byJin et al.[29]. According to first-principle calculations, the specific heat capacity, which consists of magnetic, lattice, and electronic contributions, depends mostly on the latter two, with negligible electronic contributions[29]. Within a higher temperature range close toTC, the magnetic part becomes more pronounced. Since the CrFeCoNi alloy shows a reducedcpat temperatures above 500 K compared to CrMnFeCoNi, this difference may be either attributed to magnetic and/or lattice contributions.","['fig0010', 'fig0010']",[]
3.2.2,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Specific heat capacity,"Sincecpof CrFeCoNi shows a decrease, an exothermic reaction is expected. Due to the water quenching, a metastable state might occur, which have been gradually shifted to a steady state. Following, with decreasing disorder the energy of the system has been lowered, resulting in a decrease ofcp. Based on DFT simulations,Jin et al.[29]suggested that SRO could form at low temperatures, thereby lowering thecpvalue and the energy of the system if the atomic mobilities are sufficiently large. In a comparable system fromSun et al.[58], a slight decreases incpover a similar temperature range was observed that was attributed to SRO formation during the measurement. Additional and more recent investigations byAndreoli et al.[59]have shown the formation of SRO and confirmed their formation by first-principle simulations of the electronic density of states. Additionally, like already mentioned, significant influences might come from magnetic contributions to the specific heat capacity. A recent study fromWoodgate et al.[60], showed that the magnetic configuration significantly influences SRO effects and can therefore be a determining factor regarding the CrFeCoNi signal. Since this could only be measured in CrFeCoNi, this could be the reason for the difference to the other alloys[60]. By employing ESR measurements, a more detailed insight on the electronic contribution to the specific heat capacity will be provided inSection 3.3.",[],[]
3.2.3,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Thermal diffusivity,"In former studies, we have shown for Fe-based alloys that thermal diffusivity plays a pivotal role in determining thermal conductivity[61–64]. Thermal diffusivity is of immense importance when it comes to the time-temperature characteristics of materials. This is emphasized in the basic principles of the heat conduction equation, underscoring its significant impact on the dynamic heat transfer[65]. Furthermore, the thermal diffusivity is determined by factors that influence both electronic and thermal heat transfer with the corresponding scattering of electrons and phonons, making this parameter highly important. For the alloys investigated in this study, the temperature dependent thermal diffusivity obtained by laser flash analysis is shown in Fig. 2 c. Here, it is noteworthy that there are only minor differences in RT- and HT-thermal diffusivities.",['fig0010'],[]
3.2.3,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Thermal diffusivity,"Despite the apparent similarity in these materials, a significant temperature dependency is noticeable. Nevertheless, when it comes to RT thermal diffusivity, CrCoNi shows the fastest heat transfer, followed by CrFeCoNi and CrFeNi, which show nearly identical thermal diffusivities at RT, while CrMnFeCoNi exhibits the slowest heat transfer between 300 K and 773 K. Interestingly, the three-element alloys (CrCoNi and CrFeNi) show a higher thermal conductivity than the quaternary and quinary alloys. This result can be attributed to the fact that alloying elements act as scattering sites for the phononic heat transfer, thus reducing thermal diffusivity and conductivity[66,67]. In other words, for equatomic alloys, the higher the number of elements, the lower the thermal diffusivity.",[],[]
3.2.3,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Thermal diffusivity,"A similar increase in thermal diffusivity with rising temperature is observed for all alloys studied. This increase suggests that the electronic contribution to the thermal diffusivity, which typically increases with rising temperature in metals and alloys with an fcc lattice, determines the temperature dependency, since it counteracts the increased phononic scattering occurring with rising temperature[67]. Compared to austenitic stainless steels (e.g., AISI 316 L[61,62]), the slopes of thea(T)-curves in Fig. 2 c are significantly larger for the HEA and MEAs. This difference may be attributed to the fact that some of the solutes in AISI 316 L (e.g., C and Mo) have atomic radii that differ more strongly from that of the ""average"" matrix than in the HEA and MEAs. This results in more potent scattering sites for phononic heat transfer and thus a lower slope of thea(T)-curve.",['fig0010'],[]
3.2.4,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Thermal conductivity,"According toEq. (1), the thermal conductivity is a result of multiplying the thermal diffusivity, specific heat capacity and density, which are all temperature dependent properties and accordingly show different temperature dependencies. When it comes to conventional alloys with fcc lattice, a significant effect of the thermal diffusivity on the thermal conductivity can be noticed[62,64]. Nevertheless, within the investigated equiatomic alloys, a minor impact of the thermal diffusivity is recognized ( Fig. 2 d). The most important influence is the specific heat capacity ( Fig. 2 b), which varies considerably between the HEA and MEAs. The alloys can therefore be classified in two groups, namely the MEAs consisting of three alloys CrFeNi and CrCoNi and the more complex MEA/HEA CrFeCoNi and CrMnFeCoN, with CrFeNi and CrCoNi showing a lower specific heat capacity in comparison with the more complex alloys CrFeCoNi and CrMnFeCoNi. While the CrMnFeCoNi and the CrFeCoNi exhibit nearly identicalλ(T)-curves below 550 K ( Fig. 2 d), a similarity to the austenitic stainless steel AISI 316 L at RT can be found, exhibiting a comparable thermal conductivity[61].","['fig0010', 'fig0010', 'fig0010']",[]
3.2.5,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Electrical resistivity and resulting electronic thermal conductivity,"As previously mentioned, the electronic state and its temperature dependent behavior plays a key role regarding the thermophysical properties of metallic materials. Therefore, the resistivity can be used to calculate the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity. Both the electrical resistivity and electronic thermal conductivity are displayed in Fig. 3 a and b, respectively. Additionally, the phononic contribution to the thermal conductivity as well as the electronic fraction are displayed in Fig. 3 c and d. Note that the electrical conductivity is the reciprocal value of the electrical resistivity.","['fig0015', 'fig0015']",[]
3.2.5,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Electrical resistivity and resulting electronic thermal conductivity,"The electrical resistivity at RT of the four alloys strongly differs ( Fig. 3 a). The Cantor alloy CrMnFeCoNi shows the lowest resistivity and therefore highest electrical conductivity, followed by CrFeCoNi, CrFeNi, and CrCoNi. Since all of the investigated alloys have substantial Cr contents, the electrical resistivity is quite high, as Cr is known to reduce the concentration of free electrons in the spin-up conduction channel, decreasing the ability to conduct current[68]. In comparison toJin et al.[28], the reported resistivity of the alloys CrCoNi, CrFeCoNi, and CrMnFeCoNi was lower at 300 K than the findings of this study. This difference could be attributed to variations in the manufacturing process, asJin et al.[28]investigated CrCoNi and CrFeCoNi as single crystals, while CrMnFeCoNi had much larger grains than those alloys presented in our study. Consequently, direct comparisons between the two studies should be avoided.",['fig0015'],[]
3.2.5,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Electrical resistivity and resulting electronic thermal conductivity,"Regarding the temperature dependency of the alloys, CrFeCoNi shows a less pronounced temperature-dependent increase in resistivity. This correlation, which might be a result from SRO as discussed on the basis of the DSC measurements, has also been observed byAndreoli et al.[69], who were able to detect anomalies in the logarithmic derivate of resistivity that were a result from the high temperature formation of SRO. In fcc metals and alloys, two relevant factors influence the electrical conductivity – electron scattering and electron excitation. In the latter case, an increase in electronic thermal conductivity with rising temperature, can be observed. This is due to the residual resistivity at 0 K, which is fairly high in these alloys, resulting in an almost linear increase in electronic thermal conductivity[28]. The resulting positive and nearly linear slope of the resistivity is affected by electron-phonon interaction and occurs due to the measurement temperatures that are higher than the Debye temperature[70]. In comparison to pure metals, where the phononic part is mostly negligible, these results show that the scattering of electrons is significant in the HEA and MEAs investigated here[71]. Therefore, the increase of electronic thermal conductivity leads to a positive slope of the overall thermal conductivity, which strongly correlates withTC. AboveTC, an increase in thermal conductivity is expected[72]. This positive temperature dependent slope comes from the fcc lattice and is determined by the thermal diffusivity, which is highly influenced by the electronic contribution.",[],[]
3.2.5,Results and discussion.Thermal conductivity.Electrical resistivity and resulting electronic thermal conductivity,"By comparing the electronic and phononic contributions with the overall trend in thermal conductivity, one can identify the electronic contribution as the main factor in the differing behavior. In the alloys CrMnFeCoNi and CrFeCoNi, the phononic contribution becomes less present. In contrast, the alloys CrFeNi and CrCoNi show higher phononic contributions, which is due to less scattering sites resulting from decreased complexity, so called mass disorder scattering[73], which becomes even more relevant for higher temperatures. This decreased phononic thermal conductivity can be correlated with the DSC measurements, in which a higher complexity of the alloys leads to an increased specific heat capacity ( Fig. 2 b). As the complexity increases, phononic scattering and energy required to change the internal energy of the alloy increases, leading to a more pronounced harmonic contribution ofcpand corresponding lower phononic thermal conductivity.",['fig0010'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electron spin resonance,"To get a closer insight into the electronic properties on an atomic scale, ESR measurements were carried out. Firstly, ESR allows to probe the electronic density of states (DOS), which provides crucial information about the distribution of electrons within the orbitals of a material. This information is fundamental for understanding the electronic structure and behavior of materials, which in turn influences their thermophysical and mechanical properties. In addition, ESR is sensitive to the presence of SRO in alloys[32]. SRO can have significant impacts on the material properties, including thermal conductivity and diffusivity, as already reported in the literature[29,74–76]and seen in this study, especially regarding the differences in specific heat capacity in CrFeCoNi in comparison to the other HEA/MEA. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of SRO is crucial in tuning the properties of these group of alloys. One can detect and characterize SRO effects by measuring ESR signals, providing insights into the microstructural features that influence thermophysical behavior. Therefore, ESR spectra of CrMnFeCoNi, CrFeCoNi and CrFeNi are shown in Fig. 4 .",['fig0020'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electron spin resonance,"Within the measurements, a weak but present CESR signal was only detectable in CrCoNi, showing the presence of effects that mask the signal of conduction electrons in all alloys, already giving a hint about SRO-effects in the investigated HEA and MEAs. Since CESR was only detectable in CrCoNi the corresponding ESR spectra with the calculated CESR signals inθ= 0° andθ= 90° is displayed in Fig. 5 .",['fig0025'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electron spin resonance,"The observations regarding conduction electrons are due to paramagnetic and ferromagnetic absorption weakening the conduction electron signal. Therefore, no CESR was detectable in CrMnFeCoNi, CrFeCoNi and CrFeNi and only a weak CESR was detectable in CrCoNi. Regarding this, SRO is expected in all of the investigated alloys, since a CESR signal has to be present but could not be measured. The details of this phenomenon will be described in the following. As the magnetic field aligns with the sample plane, ESR-resonance fields exist in all samples, as shown inTables 4 and 5.",[],"['tbl0020', 'tbl0025']"
3.3,Results and discussion.Electron spin resonance,"While the signals exhibit similarities, the resonance field shifts in the presence of ferromagnetic inclusions. Consequently, the signal atHres=3150 G is attributed to the paramagnetic center (PC) with ag-factor of 2.135. PC are inherent in solid solutions of transition metals due to charge compensation or imperfections in the crystalline structure, for example, stacking faults. By substituting Fe with Ni or Cr, a change in the free electron system occurs, making these atoms paramagnetic. As reported, the correlation ofg-value and magnetic susceptibility of different electronic systems can be used to identify different atomic distributions[33]. Firstly, magnetic susceptibility is influenced by free electrons, including itinerant electrons, d1-subsystems of d-electrons in combination with isolated atoms and d2-subsystems or superparamagnetic clusters (clusters of d-atoms).",[],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electron spin resonance,"Therefore, the existence of paramagnetic influences is suggested by the presence ofg||=2.135,g⊥=2.34, pointing out the presence of Ni2+[77]. This can be seen in the ESR spectrum of CrFeNi atθ= 90°. This signal represents an averaged powder spectrum as Ni2+is randomly distributed. The second paramagnetic signal, characterized by ag-factor of 1.98, corresponds to the PC Cr2+with an anisotropicgθ=0°=1.98 andgθ=90°=1.95. The broad width of these signals impedes their observation atθ= 0°. Accordingly, there is a direct connection between the ESR signal of CrFeNi as described here and SRO in this particular alloy.",[],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electron spin resonance,"The ferromagnetic signal observed at low fields arises from the presence of ferromagnetic clusters. To ensure that the resonance field is shifted to these lower fields by the anisotropic field and demagnetization field, these fields must be sufficiently large, such that the ferromagnetic atomic scale areas are primarily composed of Fe. By employing the theory of angular dependence of ferromagnetic resonance field[78]and considering the anisotropy fieldAmuch larger than the demagnetization field, expressed asB2=2πM(n2-n3)andB3= 2πM(n1-n3), withMbeing the magnetization of the ferromagnetic particle, andn1,n2,n3are the coefficients of the shape anisotropy, one can derive:(6)Hres, θ=0°= 2B3–B2+ ((ωmw/γ)2+B22))0.5(7)Hres, θ=90°=B3– 2B2+ ((ωmw/γ)2+B32))0.5",[],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electron spin resonance,"Given (ωmw/γ) =3400 G,Hres, θ=0°= 200 G, andHres, θ=90°=750 G, solving the equation yieldsB3=-1241 G andB2=819.2 G. These results collectively indicate that the crystalline structure contains a significant number of grains, with grain boundarys harboring numerous PC. Therefore, a SRO can be attributed in all investigated alloys.",[],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electron spin resonance,"Since it was possible to obtain CESR signals in CrCoNi, a comparison of theg-factor with literature values will be carried out. By this, the concentration of free electrons cannot be quantified but estimated in a qualitative manner. Theg-value of the 1.7 of CrCoNi in the CESR spectra is lower than that found in austenitic stainless steels from other studies[31,79]. The CESR signal shape and lowg-value indicate a strong exchange interaction of free electrons with PC[80]and s-d hybridization, which decreases DOS at the Fermi surface. Due to this decreased concentration, a higher electrical resistivity and therefore lower electronic thermal conductivity of CrCoNi is expected, which is validated by the thermophysical properties (see Fig. 3 ), similar to previous observations in austenitic stainless steels reported in literature[50,69,70].",['fig0015'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Electron spin resonance,"By taking the DSC measurements ofcpin CrFeCoNi ( Fig. 2 b) and the SRO shown by ESR measurements into account, one has to consider the formation of SRO in CrFeCoNi during the heating stage of the DSC measurement. Additionally,Andreoli et al.[59]showed a SRO formation in this alloy after subsequent heating cycles. Therefore, a decelerated formation of SRO is expected in comparison to the other alloys, since a weak exothermic signal could be detected by DSC, showing a non-equilibrium state after homogenization in CrFeCoNi. According to first-principle calculationtrs byNiu et al.[81]in the CrFeCoNi alloy, ordering of Cr takes place to minimize the systems energy, giving this arrangement an energetic minimum, leading to a decrease in the specific heat capacity while heating. According toBykov et al.[82]andJin et al.[29], these effects result from K-state transitions due to heating that lead to SRO. As all other materials have shown SRO directly after annealing, we were not able to show a significant influence on the thermophysical properties in CrMnFeCoNi, CrFeNi and CrCoNi, in contrast to what has already been shown by simulations[59]. This might be a result from magnetic effects, as CrFeCoNi is the only alloy that shows a ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) in both alignments of the magnetic field. As shown byWoodgate et al.[60], the magnetism is a significant factor regarding SRO effects and therefore might influence the magnetic contribution to the specific heat capacity significantly. Additionally, the Cr-Cr combination, as discussed byAndreoli et al.[59]and described as Cr2+here, is a direct result of the orientation of magnetic moments, underlining this statement.",['fig0010'],[]
4,Conclusion,"This study presents an investigation of the temperature-dependent thermophysical properties of a high-entropy alloy and three medium-entropy alloys, i.e., CrMnFeCoNi, CrFeCoNi, CrFeNi, and CrCoNi, respectively. Measurements were conducted between RT and 773 K, using the dynamic measurement principle to access density, thermal expansion, thermal diffusivity, and specific heat capacity individually and temperature dependent. This procedure enabled a closer understanding of the influences on the overall thermal conductivity and its temperature dependent behavior of the investigated alloys. Additionally, the electrical resistivity was systematically measured, allowing for the application of the Franz-Wiedemann law. Subsequently, the Franz-Wiedemann law was utilized to compute the electronic contribution to the thermal conductivity. This approach provided a detailed understanding of independent parameters. By ESR-measurements, an insight into SRO effects in the investigated CCAs was done. Key findings regarding the thermophysical properties of the investigated HEA and MEAs are:-In contrast to iron-based alloys, thermal diffusivity did not emerge as a significant factor in distinguishing the materials studied.-The specific heat capacity predominantly influenced variations in the resulting thermal conductivity.-With increasing chemical complexity, the specific heat capacity and the corresponding thermal conductivity increased.-Phononic contribution to thermal conductivity increases with reducing chemical complexity, whereas higher complexity leads to an increased electronic contribution to thermal conductivity.-Short-range ordering in the investigated alloys has a significant influence on the specific heat capacity of CrFeCoNi.",[],[]
