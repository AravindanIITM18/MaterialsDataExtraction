0,Abstract,"An equiatomic NiFeCrCoMn alloy, two non-equiatomic NiFeCrCoMn alloys optimized for low stacking fault energy, and an equiatomic NiFeCrCo alloy were produced by arc melting. Samples were homogenized, cold rolled, and annealed at temperatures between 575 and 1100°C. Samples annealed at a moderate temperature near their recrystallization temperature (625–675°C) and 1100°C were cut into flat tensile samples and tested at a strain rate of 7.3×10−4                     s−1. Equiatomic NiFeCrCo had the highest ductility and toughness after annealing at both temperatures, followed by Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5. Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20 exhibited poor thermal stability, forming σ-phase intermetallics at temperatures below 1100°C. Observation of the fracture surfaces suggested that the high performance of NiFeCrCo might be due to the absence of oxide particles that form in the Mn-containing alloys. The strain-hardening rate and exponent were calculated from the results, showing a large deviation from typical behavior and significant grain size dependence.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have recently attracted attention as a new paradigm in alloy development. Traditional alloys are usually based on one primary element, with additional elements added to affect specific properties. HEAs, however, contain several elements in high proportions, with the goal of producing a stable solid solution, thus having high mixing entropy[1]. The common definition for an HEA is an alloy with five or more elements in concentrations from 5 to 35at%. As HEAs have no “base” element, the properties of the resultant alloy can be unexpected and difficult to predict[2]. While it was initially supposed that the high mixing entropy would be a major factor in stabilizing the solid solution for alloys of this type, it has been more recently found that enthalpy and atomic size differences are still significant, further increasing the difficulty of developing such alloys[3]. Some recent works have also shown that the formation of intermetallics can be controlled in some alloys as a strengthening mechanism[4].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Since its initial description by Cantor et al. in 2004[5], NiFeCrCoMn and similar alloys have been among the most widely studied multi-component solid solution, or “high entropy”, alloys. Previous studies of the mechanical properties of this alloy have focused on temperature effects in the equiatomic alloy[6]or alloys that are far from the equiatomic condition[7]. NiFeCrCoMn is already known to have good mechanical properties. Additionally, both its tensile strength and ductility increase at cryogenic temperatures, as deformation-induced twinning becomes a more prominent deformation mechanism[6]. This suggests that it has a moderate stacking fault energy (SFE), which agrees with XRD-based measurements of the SFE[8].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Generally, in low-SFE materials, dislocation cross-slip and climb is impeded, as dissociation into partial dislocations with a wide spacing is more energetically favorable. They are more likely to deform by twinning. These effects increase the dislocation storage capacity, increase strain-hardening through the “dynamic Hall–Petch” effect of the deformation twins and result in an increase to both strength and ductility[9–13]. Sarma et al.[14]describe the change in deformation mechanisms in Cu–Al alloys as a function of temperature and SFE. As the Al content increases (and the SFE decreases), twinning becomes the predominant deformation mechanism, with a lower SFE required for deformation twinning at room temperature deformation than is required at cryogenic temperatures[14].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In addition to copper alloys, reducing the SFE has also been found to induce twinning and increase strength in Mg-based alloys[15]. This behavior is also exploited in austenitic steel alloys to produce twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steels, which have high strength and good ductility[16].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In this study, we describe the results of room temperature tensile tests of non-equiatomic NiFeCrCoMn alloys optimized for low SFE. This includes the low-SFE alloy described in[8]as well as an additional alloy with an increased cobalt content[17]. For comparison, tests are also conducted on equiatomic NiFeCrCoMn and NiFeCrCo. Table 1 lists the nominal compositions, stacking fault energies[8,17], thermodynamic data[18], and average atomic size difference (δ)[19,20]for the alloys used in this study. As a convention, numbers in subscripts are compositions in at%, and alloys specified without subscripts are equiatomic.",[],['t0005']
2,Experimental procedure,Bulk samples were prepared by arc melting pure metals (>99%) on a water-cooled copper hearth in a Ti-gettered argon atmosphere. Samples were flipped and remelted at least 3 times before being drop cast into a water-cooled 7mm diameter cylindrical copper mold. Chemical analysis was performed using a Hitachi S3200N SEM equipped with an Oxford EDS detector to verify that all elements were within ±1at% of the intended composition. Sections 2–3mm thick were cut from the cylinders using a low-speed diamond saw. Samples were then homogenized at 1000°C for 24h in an Ar–2% H2atmosphere and cooled in the furnace. The homogenized samples were then cold-rolled to ~80% reduction with the rolling direction changed between passes to obtain more equal final dimensions.,[],[]
2,Experimental procedure,"In order to determine an optimal recrystallization temperature for each alloy, small samples of the rolled material were annealed for 1h at temperatures 575–1100°C. The samples were then polished and tested with a microhardness tester at a 50g load using 10 indents per sample. X-ray diffraction analysis to check for intermetallics or phase separation was done using a Rigaku SmartLab with a Cu Kα source at 40kV and 44mA.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedure,"Tensile samples were produced by annealing rolled sheets at medium temperatures near the recrystallization temperature (625–675°C, depending on the sample) and at high temperature (1100°C). “Dog bone” samples with thickness of 0.2–0.4mm, gage length of ~2.5mm, and gage width of ~1mm were cut from the sheets using a miniature CNC mill and were polished using SiC paper and Al2O3suspension. The thickness of each sample was measured using a digital micrometer and the length and width of the gage section were measured with the ImageJ software[21]from optical microscope images of each sample with a calibration slide. Tensile tests were done using a micro-tensile tester at a strain rate of 7.3×10–4s–1. Analysis of the stress–strain data was done using Origin 9.0 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) and Microsoft Excel 2010. SEM analysis of the fracture surfaces and gage surfaces was done using the aforementioned SEM. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analysis of gage surfaces was done using a Bruker Dimension 3000 in intermittent contact (tapping) mode and MikroMasch RiteProbe TSP1 tip. Samples were cleaned with acetone and methanol prior to AFM measurements. Grain size measurements were done using the line-intercept method on optical micrographs of samples etched in a solution of 2.5g CuCl2, 50mL ethanol, and 50mL HCl.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Recrystallization and grain growth behavior," Fig. 1 shows the hardness vs. annealing temperature and homologous temperature (based on the solidus temperature reported in[22]for equiatomic NiFeCrCoMn) for all of the alloys. The Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20alloy appears to retain its as-rolled hardness up to 700°C, but XRD analysis of the annealed material showed that this was a result of the formation of σ-phase intermetallics. However, the Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20sample annealed at 1100°C did not contain any measurable amount of σ-phase, nor was it observed in any other samples. Development of σ-phase in Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20is consistent with the empirical predictions made in[23], that Cr-containing HEAs with a valence electron concentration (VEC) between 6.88 and 7.84 are prone to σ formation. Its average VEC is 7.76, in contrast to all of the other alloys studied which have VEC≥8. SEM observations did show the presence of manganese and chromium oxide particles in all of the Mn-containing samples, but no oxide peaks are seen in the XRD spectra, confirming that they are present in a very low volume fraction, consistent with results seen in other studies[24]where they were assumed to have no effect on the mechanical properties.",['f0005'],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Recrystallization and grain growth behavior,"In the other samples, the as-rolled hardness is nearly the same and they follow similar trends, particularly at high temperatures, with NiFeCrCoMn having a slightly higher recrystallization temperature than the other alloys. For the tensile test samples, to compare alloys at similar stages of recrystallization, different temperatures were chosen using Fig. 1 to anneal the medium-temperature samples. The recrystallization temperatures chosen for the tensile samples were: 625°C for NiFeCrCo and Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5, 650°C for NiFeCrCoMn, and 675°C for Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20. A higher temperature was used for the latter sample to ensure complete recrystallization. All samples were annealed for 1h. The grain sizes of the moderate temperature-annealed samples were found to be ~1–2μm and the 1100°C-annealed samples were 60–80μm.",['f0005'],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Tensile tests,"Representative engineering stress–strain curves for all of the samples are shown in Fig. 2 . As expected from the hardness measurements and the known presence of intermetallics, Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20annealed at 675°C has a very high strength, but negligible ductility. Unexpectedly, reducing the stacking fault energy in that alloy did not result in an improvement in the mechanical properties. After annealing at 1100°C, Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20performed similarly to the equiatomic alloy, but with 7% and 13% lower tensile strength and toughness, respectively. Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5had a higher ductility than the other 5-component alloys, but at the expense of a reduction in strength. The highest strength alloy that was still ductile was the equiatomic alloy annealed at 650°C.",['f0010'],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Tensile tests," Table 2 shows the quantitative measurements from the tensile tests: 0.2% offset yield stress, tensile strength, total plastic elongation, uniform elongation, and toughness (defined as the area under the curve). For both the medium and high temperature-annealed samples, the toughest sample by a significant margin was the equiatomic 4-component alloy. It has a yield strength comparable to the Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5alloys, but with significantly higher ductility and tensile strength. Additionally, the alloys are compared to three low-stacking fault energy twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steels reported in[25]. The grain size of the TWIP steels was not reported and, based on the reported strength, likely falls between the grain sizes tested in this study. Nevertheless, NiFeCrCo and Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5appear to perform comparably to the TWIP steels, suggesting a possible use as energy absorbing materials for transportation applications.",[],['t0010']
3.2,Results and discussion.Tensile tests,"In single-phase alloys such as these, it is expected that solid solution strengthening has a major role in the mechanical properties. The effects of this can be observed in the results of the coarse-grained samples. For the contribution from solid solution strengthening, the stress required to move a dislocation is affected by both lattice distortion and shear modulus differences[13,26]. From the values ofδin Table 1 , it can be seen that the lattice distortion in these alloys is relatively small and not substantially different between any of the 5-component alloys. The shear moduli of iron, nickel, cobalt, and manganese are also similar, 82GPa, 76GPa, 75GPa, and 81GPa, respectively (the shear modulus of Mn is estimated using Young׳s modulus, bulk modulus, and isotropic elastic constant relationships). The shear modulus of chromium however is much higher, 115GPa[27]. Indeed, the alloys with the highest Cr content, NiFeCrCo (25%) and Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20have the highest yield strengths of the coarse-grained samples. In the fine-grain samples, Hall–Petch strengthening likely plays a more dominant role.",[],['t0005']
3.2,Results and discussion.Tensile tests," Fig. 3 shows the fracture surfaces of the NiFeCrCo (a) and NiFeCrCoMn (b) 1100°C samples. While both show the typical dimpled appearance of a ductile fracture surface, there is a substantial difference in the appearance of the two fracture surfaces. The surface of NiFeCrCo contains numerous small dimples,<2μm. In contrast, the NiFeCrCoMn contains mostly large dimples with small particles visible inside. EDS analysis shows that these are the Mn–Cr oxide particles common to most cast NiFeCrCoMn-alloy systems. The fracture surfaces of all of the Mn-containing alloys showed a similar appearance. This suggests that while the oxide particles do not affect the yield strength of the alloys, they do have a deleterious effect on the ductility and toughness as preferred nucleation sites for microvoids[28]. As NiFeCrCo does not contain any second phase particles, microvoid nucleation likely occurs on smaller defects, requiring a larger critical stress[29].",['f0015'],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Tensile tests,"A significant effect on the gage surfaces of the samples was also observed after testing. The samples were polished prior to testing, but underwent significant roughening or wrinkling during the tests indicating substantial out-of-plane and localized deformation. The effect is most noticeable on the coarse-grained samples but it does also affect the finer-grained samples. Both samples of Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5are shown in Fig. 4 . The RMS roughness of the 625°C-annealed sample is 114nm and the total variation between the lowest and highest points is ~800nm, on a similar order as the grain size. As the relatively low stacking fault energy of the alloys impedes cross-slip and climb, mechanisms involving high localized and grain-scale deformation reorient the crystal to maximize shear stress along preferred slip systems to enable dislocation glide[30,31]. The effect in the coarse-grained was likely exacerbated by the low thickness of the sample, which was only a small multiple of the grain size; therefore, it may deviate from conventional polycrystal behavior.",['f0020'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Strain-hardening behavior,"There are several common methods used to measure strain-hardening from tensile test data using the true stress and true strain during plastic deformation up to the point of necking. The most common method[13]uses the equation:(1)σ=KεnwhereKis the strength coefficient and n is the strain-hardening exponent. The values can be calculated using a linear fit to the true stress–true strain curve on a log–log plot. Using this method, one obtains rather low values fornfor the HEAs tested here, 0.12–0.18 for the medium temperature-annealed samples (excluding Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20, for which the plastic deformation was too short for a reasonable fit). However, the log–log true strain data is not very linear, resulting inR2coefficients of determination for linear fits of 0.92–0.97.",[],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Strain-hardening behavior,"Another method[13]uses a similar equation:(2)σ=σ0+Kεnwhereσ0is the yield stress. Using a fit of this type,R2is improved to better than 0.998 for the finer-grained sample results. However, this method still results in a poor fit to the high temperature-annealed sample data, particularly at low strain values, at which the residuals are as high as 35MPa.",[],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Strain-hardening behavior,"The strain-hardening exponent at any given point on the stress–strain curve can also be derived from the strain-hardening rate[13,16]:(3)n=dσdεεσ",[],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Strain-hardening behavior,"Plots showing the strain-hardening rate and exponent calculated using Eq.(3)as a function of true stress are shown in Fig. 5 . To produce these, the original data was smoothed to reduce the random electronic noise between points using an adjacent-averaging method and increasing the distance between points. Some noise is still present, visible as the slight oscillations between points at high stress.",['f0025'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Strain-hardening behavior,"An interesting trend can be observed in the results. For most of the alloys, the strain-hardening behavior is dependent on the grain size. The coarse-grained samples annealed at 1100°C all follow a nearly identical trend independent of the composition, in which the exponent gradually increases, then remains constant at around ~0.6. The strain-hardening rate rapidly drops up to ~100MPa, and then remains nearly constant. In the finer-grained samples annealed at lower temperatures, there is a substantial difference; the strain-hardening rate continuously decreases with increasing stress, leading to a much lower exponent, with the equiatomic NiFeCrCoMn being the lowest. The exception to this is the 4-component equiatomic alloy, in which the fine-grain sample behaves more similar to the coarse-grain sample, with a strain-hardening exponent ~0.7. This difference is apparent when comparing NiFeCrCo to Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5annealed at 625°C. The yield stress of the Co-rich alloy is 46MPa larger, but at 24.3% strain, the stress on the NiFeCrCo sample is 50MPa larger. This rapid strain-hardening contributes significantly to the toughness of NiFeCrCo, allowing it to outperform the substantially stronger NiFeCrCoMn by almost 80%.",[],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Strain-hardening behavior,"The strain-hardening rate is also comparable to, if not higher than, that of the previously discussed TWIP steels. In the flat portion of the strain-hardening curve, the TWIP steels harden at a rate of 800–1200MPa[25]while the alloys reported in this study harden at a rate of 1000–1500MPa.",[],[]
3.4,Results and discussion.Effect of stacking fault energy,"Reducing the stacking fault energy did not have as large of an effect on strength and ductility as was expected. At 1100°C, the yield strength of Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20was slightly improved over the equiatomic alloy, but ductility was poorer. The increased Cr content may have increased the number of oxide particles. In addition, the alloy exhibited poor thermal stability, forming σ-phase particles after annealing at temperatures <1100°C preventing assessment of the strength and ductility of the fcc matrix with a fine grain structure. Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5exhibited higher ductility than the equiatomic 5-component alloy, but a lower strength after the moderate-temperature anneal, even when using a lower recrystallization temperature than the equiatomic alloy. The high-Co alloy did however have a 10–15% greater toughness compared to NiFeCrCoMn at both annealing temperatures.",[],[]
3.4,Results and discussion.Effect of stacking fault energy,"In the case of NiFeCrCo, it is difficult to say whether the improvement is a result of the SFE (which is expected to be similar to, if not higher than, NiFeCrCoMn) or the lack of oxide particles. The higher ductility and strain-hardening rate compared to the other alloys suggest that a low SFE and deformation twinning are factors in the mechanical properties. The higher coarse-grain yield strength compared to NiFeCrCoMn may be a result of the lower SFE, or, as discussed earlier, a result of solid solution strengthening due to the higher Cr content.",[],[]
3.4,Results and discussion.Effect of stacking fault energy,"A prior study did not observe any deformation twinning in equiatomic NiFeCrCoMn during room temperature tensile tests[6]. However, another study using rolling rather than tensile testing did find evidence of deformation twinning at room temperature[32]. Therefore, the presence of twinning, especially at extremely high strains cannot be ruled out entirely. In similar materials that show significant deformation by twinning, such as TWIP steels, it is known that twin nucleation and other deformation mechanisms that affect strain-hardening behavior are grain size-dependent[16]. A similar trend is observed here in the NiFeCrCoMn and Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5results in which, after the initial decrease, the strain-hardening rate is larger in the finer grained samples. Further research is needed to determine the deformation mechanisms in NiFeCrCo and Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5.",[],[]
4,Conclusion,"Low-stacking fault energy NiFeCrCoMn-based high entropy alloys were produced by arc melting, rolling, and recrystallization. Tensile tests were conducted in order to characterize their mechanical properties as a function of grain size and composition.",[],[]
4,Conclusion,"All of the alloys exhibited similar recrystallization and grain growth behavior after ~80% rolling reduction, with recrystallization temperatures 625–675°C. Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20exhibited poor thermal stability, forming σ-phase particles when annealed below 1100°C. All other samples remained single-phase fcc, except for a small (undetectable by X-ray diffraction) volume fraction of manganese-containing oxide particles in all alloys except NiFeCrCo.",[],[]
4,Conclusion,"NiFeCrCo exhibited the best combination of strength and ductility in both coarse grain and fine grain conditions, with yield strength of nearly 200MPa and uniform elongation of 70% after annealing at 1100°C, and 80% higher toughness than NiFeCrCoMn after the same processing conditions. Ni18.5Fe18.5Cr18.5Co26Mn18.5, which adds additional cobalt to the base alloy to reduce the SFE had a 30% improvement in elongation compared to the equiatomic alloy, but at the expense of an 11% reduction in yield strength in the fine-grain condition. The reduced ductility of all of the Mn-containing samples compared to NiFeCrCo is attributed to the oxide particles, which act as preferred nucleation sites for microvoids.",[],[]
4,Conclusion,"The strain-hardening behavior of the alloys was characterized using the strain-hardening rate and exponent as a function of stress. Strain-hardening shows a strong grain size dependence, with fine-grain samples having a much lower strain-hardening exponent and continuously decreasing strain-hardening rate. Coarse-grain samples have a high strain-hardening exponent and nearly constant strain-hardening rate (after an initial decrease). The exception to this is NiFeCrCo, which has a high exponent and constant rate regardless of the grain size, contributing to its high toughness. The alloys perform comparably to twinning-induced plasticity steels in terms of ductility and strain-hardening, suggesting a possible application as energy-absorbing materials.",[],[]
