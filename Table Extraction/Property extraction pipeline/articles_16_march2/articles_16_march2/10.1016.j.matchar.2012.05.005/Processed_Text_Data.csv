The effects of variations in the amount of Mo on the microstructure and mechanical properties were investigated. The CoCrFeNi alloy exhibits a single face-centered cubic solid solution, whereas a (Cr,Mo)-rich σ phase is observed in the face-centered cubic matrix after the addition of Mo into the alloy. A (Mo,Cr)-rich μ phase appears on the fringes of the σ phase in the CoCrFeNiMo0.85 alloy. The hardness of face-centered cubic matrix and the σ-phase content increase with increasing Mo concentration, resulting in an increase in the alloy hardness, from HV135 to HV420. The compressive strength of the alloy improves as the Mo content increasing, but a simultaneous degradation of the ductility is observed. Accordingly, as the Mo content increases from 0 to 0.85, the yield stress and compressive strength rise from 136MPa and 871MPa to 929MPa and 1441MPa, respectively, and the fracture strain lowers from 75% to 21%. The solid-solution strengthening of the face-centered cubic matrix and the formation of the σ/or σ+μ phases are the two main reasons for the strengthening of the alloy.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Alloys without a major element—that is, alloys constructed using at least five principal elements—were first explored by Yeh et al. since 1996 and published in 2004[1–3]. Such an alloy, termed a high-entropy alloy, is defined as containingnprincipal elements (typicallyn≧5), each with concentrations between 5at.% and 35at.%. Because of the high mixing entropy ΔSmixof alloys with multi-principal elements, the microstructure of high-entropy alloys usually displays some simple solid solutions during solidification, instead of complex phases or inter-metallic compounds[1–9]. The Al–Co–Cr–Cu–Fe–Ni alloy system was the first to be studied in terms of its microstructure and mechanical properties, and has since been widely investigated[6,10–14]. Despite the segregation of Cu in interdendritic regions, the crystal structure of the alloys displayed simple face-centered cubic (FCC) and/or body-centered cubic (BCC) solid solutions, depending on the concentrations of each principal element. Al strongly promotes the formation of BCC phases; a study of AlxCoCrCuFeNi alloys showed that the crystal structure was transformed from FCC to BCC as the Al content was increased[10].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Recently, to expand and enrich the field of multiprincipal component alloys, some researchers have studied the microstructure and compressive properties of Mo-containing alloys such as VNbMoTaW, AlCoCrCuFeNiMox, and AlCoCrFeNiMox[15–17]. These alloys generally showed BCC or BCC+α(unidentified Mo-rich phase) microstructure at room temperature, and exhibited high compressive strengths but inferior fracture strains, with values near 3%. These poor fracture strain properties resulted from the presence of the hard BCC solid solution, reducing the ductility of the alloy. By contrast, if a high-entropy alloy is formed with a strong but ductile FCC matrix and a hard secondary phase, a good ductility can be approached although some strength may be sacrificed.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The mechanical properties of FCC high-entropy alloys are seldom reported. Motivated by this fact, we did not include the strongly BCC-forming Al in the alloy studied here, but instead prepared CoCrFeNiMoxalloys. The effects of variations in the Mo content on the microstructure and properties of the alloys were investigated in detail.",[],[]
2,Materials and Methods,"Four multiprincipal component CoCrFeNiMox(x=0, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.85, in molar ratio, denoted Mo0, Mo0.3, Mo0.5, and Mo0.85respectively) alloys were synthesized by arc melting under a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere in a water-cooled copper crucible. Elemental Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Mo of 99wt.% purity were used as raw materials. The ingot was melted 5 times to ensure homogeneity. The size of the ingot was approximately 60mm×40mm×10mm. The microstructure and chemical composition of the alloys were examined using scanning electron microscopy (HITACHI-S3000) and energy dispersive spectrometer.Table 1lists the chemical compositions of the as-cast alloys. The crystal structures were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (Bruker D8 SSS), using Cu Kαradiation scanning from 20 to 100 degrees in 2θ, at a scanning rate of 4 degree/min. Macrohardness and microhardness were measured using a Vickers hardness tester (FUTURE-TECH FR-300e) with loads of 1kg and 5g, respectively, with a duration of 15s. Compressive tests were carried out onϕ5×10mm samples using a materials testing machine (CHUN-YEN CY6040A4) with a strain rate of 1.6×10−3s−1.",[],['t0005']
3.1,Results and Discussion.Crystal Structure,"The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns for the as-cast CoCrFeNiMoxalloys are shown inFig. 1. All alloys display a major A1-type FCC solid solution matrix. This is attributed to the high mixing entropy effect which can effectively reduces the Gibbs free energy of mixing, and consequently facilitated the formation of FCC solid solution during solidification. The Mo0and Mo0.3alloys display a single FCC solid solution. However, some weak peaks beside the FCC(111) are detected for the Mo0.5alloy. In combination with the EDS analysis shown inSection 3.2, these diffraction peaks are correlated with a secondary phase which is identified as a D8b-type σ phase (a=9.165Å,c=4.739Å,c/a=0.517), and its structure is close to a tetragonal FeCrMo phase, according to the JCPDS card number 09‐0050. In addition to the FCC matrix and σ phase, another weak diffraction peak is observed on the left side of the XRD pattern for the Mo0.85alloy. This is attributed to a D85-type μ phase (a=4.757Å,c=25.589Å,c/a=5.379), and its structure is close to a rhombohedral Co7Mo6phase, according to the JCPDS card number 29‐0489. The lattice parameter of the FCC matrix for Mo0to Mo0.85alloy is found to increase gradually from 3.561Å to 3.619Å. This change results from the addition of the solid-solution atom of Mo into the FCC matrix. The fact that the atomic radius of Mo (1.39Å) is larger than that of the other constitutional elements (Co (1.25Å), Cr (1.28Å), Fe (1.26Å) and Ni (1.24Å)) explains this lattice expansion.",['f0005'],[]
3.2,Results and Discussion.Microstructure,Fig. 2shows a scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the Mo0alloy. A homogeneously crystalline structure with a grain size of 300–500μm is observed. The formation of a simple FCC solid solution is due to the effects of the approximately atomic size of the four constitutional elements and the lack of any significantly negative or positive mixing enthalpy of atom pairs between each element[18].,['f0010'],[]
3.2,Results and Discussion.Microstructure,"The microstructures of the Mo0.3, Mo0.5, and Mo0.85high-entropy alloys are shown inFig. 3. All of the three alloys display a typical dendritic structure as illustrated in the low magnification images ofFig. 3(a), (c), and (e). It is clear that the volume fraction of second phases in the interdendrite region increases with increasing Mo content.Table 2lists the chemical compositions of the interior structures marked inFig. 3as A, B, and C. In the Mo0.3alloy, as shown inFig. 3(b), structure A is dendrite (DR) and structure B is interdendrite (ID). The major difference between the chemical compositions of these two structures is that the ID contained more Mo than the DR. From the XRD analysis inFig. 1, both the DR and ID are determined to be the FCC phase. In addition, a (Cr,Mo)-rich phase (structure C) is found in the ID. This (Cr,Mo)-rich phase was not detected by XRD due to the fact that it was present in small quantities. As shown inFig. 3(d), the microstructure of the Mo0.5alloy is similar to that of the Mo0.3alloy, but more of the (Cr,Mo)-rich phases are formed in the ID. This (Cr,Mo)-rich phase is verified to be a σ phase in the XRD analysis. According to the electron‐hole theory as applied to superalloys[19], Cr and Mo are key elements in the formation of σ phases, since they both have a larger electron hole number (Nv=4.66) than most transition elements. Furthermore, from the energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS) analyses, the presence of theσphase can correspond to stoichiometric (Cr,Mo)(Co,Fe,Ni). This is due to two factors: (1) Cr and Mo can be substituted for each other because they have the same BCC crystal structure and a similar electron configuration, and (2) Co, Fe, and Ni can be substituted for one another because their electronegativities are similar. In addition, from the characteristics of chemical compositions and morphology observed inFig. 3(b) and (d), the (Cr,Mo)-rich phase in the Mo0.3alloy is suggested to be theσphase too.","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0005', 'f0015', 'f0015']",['t0010']
3.2,Results and Discussion.Microstructure,"Fig. 3(f) is a back-scattering SEM image of the Mo0.85alloy. This image andTable 2show that structure A (DR) is the FCC solid solution that confirmed by XRD analysis inFig. 1. The ID is mostly composed of the dark gray structure B and smaller amounts of the light gray structure C. The XRD and EDS results reveal that structures B and C are a (Cr,Mo)-rich σ phase and a (Mo,Cr)-rich μ phase, respectively. This μ phase can correspond to stoichiometric (Mo,Cr)7(Co,Fe,Ni)6. Note that the μ phase appears on the fringes of the σ phase, indicating that it was produced by the transformation of the σ phase during solidification. We believe that occurrence of formation of the μ phase is because the σ phase is not able to maintain its tetragonal structure due to the large lattice strain created by the presence of excess Mo. To the release of the lattice strain results in the transformation of the σ phase into a rhombohedral μ phase.","['f0015', 'f0005']",['t0010']
3.3,Results and Discussion.Mechanical Properties,"Fig. 4shows variations in the alloy hardness, DR hardness, ID hardness, and FCC lattice parameter of the CoCrFeNiMoxalloys. The alloy hardness increases from HV135 to HV420 with increasing Mo content. This can be explained by the increasing hardness of the DR and the ID. For the FCC dendrite, the increase in hardness is due to the lattice distortion that results from the addition of the larger Mo atoms to the alloy. The increase in the FCC lattice parameter provides confirmation of this viewpoint. The apparent increase of alloy hardness fromx=0.3 tox=0.85 is mostly due to the increasing volume fraction of the hard σ phase in the ID. In the alloys studied here, the average hardness of σ phase is HV660.",['f0020'],[]
3.3,Results and Discussion.Mechanical Properties,"Compressive stress–strain curves are shown inFig. 5for the CoCrFeNiMoxalloys, and their relative properties are listed inTable 3. The yield stress and compressive strength of the alloys improve significantly as the Mo content is increased, but the ductility simultaneously decreases. With the increase in Mo content from 0 to 0.85, the yield stress and compressive strength increase from 136MPa and 871MPa to 929MPa and 1441MPa, respectively, while the fracture strain shows a reduction from 75% to 21%. We believe that the solid-solution strengthening of FCC matrix and the formation of the σ/or σ+μ phase are the two main factors contributing to the strengthening of the alloy. Since bothσandμphases belong to the Topological Close-Packed (TCP) group of structures, large misalignments between them and the FCC lattice lead to the accumulation of dislocations at the interface, and consequently induce stress concentration and cracking during compression. The compressive strength therefore increases with decreasing ductility. The Mo0.85alloy shows an appropriate compressive strength, but a superior fracture strain in comparison with previous studies[15–17]. This is attributed to the fact that the alloy is formed by the combination of a strong but ductile FCC matrix and hard secondary phases. This alloy has a potential for the development of a ductile, high-strength alloy.",['f0025'],['t0015']
4,Conclusions,"In this study, the effects of the addition of various amounts of Mo on the microstructure and mechanical properties of CoCrFeNiMox(x=0, 0.3, 0.5, and 0.85, in molar ratio) alloys were investigated. From XRD, SEM, and EDS analyses, the microstructures of the Mo0, Mo0.3, Mo0.5, and Mo0.85alloys are determined to be FCC, FCC+σ, FCC+σ, and FCC+σ+μ, respectively. The σ phase is found to be a (Cr,Mo)-rich phase corresponding to stoichiometric (Cr,Mo)(Co,Fe,Ni), and theμphase is found to be a (Mo,Cr)-rich phase corresponding to stoichiometric (Mo,Cr)7(Co,Fe,Ni)6. The alloy hardness, yield stress, and compressive strength increase while the ductility decreases as Mo content increasing. The solid-solution strengthening of FCC matrix and the formation of theσ/orσ+μphases are the two main factors contributing to the strengthening of the alloy. The Mo0.85alloy shows a compressive strength of 1441MPa and fracture strain of 21%, indicating the potential of this material for the development of a ductile, high-strength alloy.",[],[]
