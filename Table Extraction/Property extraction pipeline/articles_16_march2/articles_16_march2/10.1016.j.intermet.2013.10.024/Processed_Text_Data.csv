0,Abstract,"The equiatomic high-entropy alloy FeNiCoCrMn is known to crystallize as a single phase with the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure. To better understand this quinary solid solution alloy, we investigate various binary, ternary and quaternary alloys made from its constituent elements. Our goals are twofold: (i) to investigate which of these lower order systems also form solid solution alloys consisting of a single FCC phase, and (ii) to characterize their phase stability and recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth behaviors. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy with backscattered electron images showed that three of the five possible quaternaries (FeNiCoCr, FeNiCoMn and NiCoCrMn), five of the ten possible ternaries (FeNiCo, FeNiCr, FeNiMn, NiCoCr, and NiCoMn), and two of the ten possible binaries (FeNi and NiCo) were single-phase FCC solid solutions in the cast and homogenized condition, whereas the others either had different crystal structures or were multi-phase. The single-phase FCC quaternary, FeNiCoCr, along with its equiatomic ternary and binary subsidiaries, were selected for further investigations of phase stability and the thermomechanical processing needed to obtain equiaxed grain structures. Only four of these subsidiary alloys—two binaries (FeNi and NiCo) and two ternaries (FeNiCo and NiCoCr)—were found to be single-phase FCC after rolling at room temperature followed by annealing for 1 h at temperatures of 300–1100 °C. Pure Ni, which is FCC and one of the constituents of the quinary high-entropy alloy (FeNiCoCrMn), was also investigated for comparison with the higher order alloys. Among the materials investigated after thermomechanical processing (FeNiCoCr, FeNiCo, NiCoCr, FeNi, NiCo, and Ni), FeNiCo and Ni showed abnormal grain growth at relatively low annealing temperatures, while the other four showed normal grain growth behavior. The grain growth exponents for all five of the equiatomic alloys were found to be ∼0.25 (compared to ∼0.5 for unalloyed Ni), suggesting that solute drag may control grain growth in the alloys. For all five alloys, as well as for pure Ni, microhardness increases as the grain size decreases in a Hall-Petch type way. The ternary alloy NiCoCr was the hardest of the alloys investigated in this study, even when compared to the quaternary FeNiCoCr alloy. This suggests that solute hardening in equiatomic alloys depends not just on the number of alloying elements but also their type.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-entropy (HE) alloys were defined by Yeh et al.[1]as equiatomic or near-equiatomic alloys containing at least five principal elements. Their work was an attempt to rationalize why certain relatively concentrated multi-element alloys solidify as simple (BCC or FCC) solid solutions rather than with multi-phase microstructures consisting of several different intermetallic compounds—as would be the expectation from physical metallurgy intuition. Yeh et al. hypothesized that the high configurational entropies of equiatomic alloys containing five or more elements would overwhelm the enthalpies of compound formation, thereby suppressing intermetallic formation and favoring the formation of solid solutions. Consistent with such a hypothesis, it has been found that the microstructures of some HE alloys are in fact single-phase FCC[2,3]or BCC[4,5]. However, most alloys that are referred to in the literature as high-entropy alloys actually contain secondary phases [e.g., Refs.[6–8]]. In such multi-phase alloys, the configurational entropy should be much lower[9]than that of a random mixture assumed by Yeh et al.[1]and thus unlikely to be able to overcome the effects of the enthalpies of compound formation and phase separation[9]. Nevertheless, the term “high-entropy alloys” has taken hold in the literature and is now used to describe all equi- or near equi-atomic multi-component alloys containing five or more elements regardless of whether they are true single-phase solid solutions or not.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Due to the multiple alloying elements present in HE alloys, they are expected to exhibit a high degree of solid solution hardening[1]. This has led to numerous research efforts aimed at finding alloys with simple microstructures and promising mechanical properties [e.g., Refs.[2,5,10–14]]. A prominent example is the equiatomic FeNiCoCrMn alloy that was first reported by Cantor et al.[2]to solidify as a single-phase solid solution. Subsequent studies showed that it exhibits a high degree of thermodynamic stability[9], that it has excellent malleability[12], and that its grain size can be controlled by rolling and recrystallization[12–14]. Gali and George[12]first reported and Otto et al.[14]further investigated the tensile properties of this high-entropy alloy, which shows a strong increase in strength with decreasing temperature accompanied by a large increase in ductility[12,14]. Through microstructural characterization by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, the increases in ultimate tensile strength and ductility at liquid nitrogen temperature were attributed to a changeover in deformation mechanism from dislocation mediated plasticity to nano-twinning[14]. In contrast, the mechanism responsible for the strong increase in yield strength with decreasing temperature[12,14], which is atypical for pure FCC metals [e.g., Ref.[15]] but observed in binary FCC solid solutions [e.g., Refs.[16–18]], is not well understood.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"To better understand the mechanical behavior of this HE alloy (FeNiCoCrMn) and the effects of the number/type of alloying elements on mechanical properties and phase stability, it is important to systematically study its various equiatomic subsystems, namely the five quaternary, ten ternary, and ten binary alloys that can be formed from the constituent elements of the HE quinary, as shown inFig. 1. To this end, we arc melted and homogenized these sub-alloys and identified the phases present in their microstructures. Of the five quaternaries, three were found to be single-phase FCC, and from those we selected for further study the quaternary alloy FeNiCoCr and its equiatomic ternary and binary subsets. Our rationale for this selection was that: (i) the FeNiCoCr alloy has been reported to exhibit mechanical properties similar to the high-entropy FeNiCoCrMn alloy[12], and (ii) many high-entropy alloys investigated in the literature are based on the FeNiCoCr equiatomic composition to which additional elements such as Al[19], Cu[20], Mn[9,12–14], Ti, Nb, and Mo[21]are added. We also investigated pure (unalloyed) Ni to obtain a baseline against which the higher order solid solution alloys can be compared. For each of these materials, we investigated phase stability, microstructure and microhardness evolution as a function of heat treatment after cold rolling.",['fig1'],[]
2.1,Methods and experimental procedures.Phase diagram assessments,"Quaternary phase diagrams are virtually nonexistent in the literature. Therefore, we had no choice but to experimentally identify the phases present in our equiatomic quaternaries. In contrast, ternary and binary phase diagrams tend to be more common so we used them as a first step in our analysis followed by experimental verification of the phases that were actually present. All phase diagrams used in this study were taken from the ASM Alloy Phase Diagram Database[22]. The data gathered from the available phase diagrams are summarized inTable 1where the phases present at various temperatures are listed. Based on these data, the equiatomic alloys FeCoCr, FeCrMn, FeCr, NiCr, CoCr and CrMn were eliminated from further consideration since they have either the BCC crystal structure or consist of multiple phases at high temperatures. In the case of Fe–Co alloys, the FCC phase is stable only above 985 °C; at lower temperatures, either BCC or B2 is the stable phase. Additionally, phase separation has been shown to occur in a surface layer up to 70 μm in thickness (not associated with surface oxidation) at temperatures to 1300 °C[23]including at the FeCo equiatomic composition[24]. Therefore, it, too, was excluded from further study since our focus was on those alloys that are single-phase FCC at room temperature. The remaining eight ternary and five binary equiatomic alloys couldpotentiallyform single-phase FCC solid solutions, but experimental validation was necessary since phase diagrams were either not available (in some cases), or available only for a limited range of temperatures. Of the five elements in the quinary alloy (FeNiCoCrMn), only Ni has the FCC crystal structure at room temperature. Based on these starting observations, several different ingots were prepared and analyzed for experimental verification of phase stability as described below.",[],['tbl1']
2.2,Methods and experimental procedures.Alloy preparation and characterization,"Ingots of the selected equiatomic quaternaries, ternaries, binaries, and pure Ni were produced by arc melting the constituent elements (>99.9% pure) in a water-cooled copper hearth under argon atmosphere. Since Mn oxidizes easily, it was cleaned in a 25% nitric acid solution immediately before use; additionally, since it has a high vapor pressure, it was stacked between the other constituents to minimize evaporation. Even so, there was some loss of Mn during melting, and extra Mn was added to the charge to compensate for its weight loss based on our previous experience with Mn-containing HE alloys[9,12,14]. To improve compositional homogeneity, the arc-melted buttons were flipped and re-melted five times before drop casting into square cross-section copper molds measuring 12.7 mm × 12.7 mm × 127 mm.",[],[]
2.2,Methods and experimental procedures.Alloy preparation and characterization,"The drop-cast ingots were homogenized for 24 h at different temperatures, as shown inTable 1, followed by water quenching. Homogenization was performed at as high a temperature as possible without resulting in melting. After homogenization, crystal structures were examined by x-ray diffraction with Cu-target radiation at 40 kV and 40 mA on 2.54-mm thick slices. The samples were scanned through 2θranging from 20 to 90 degrees with a scan rate of 1.2 degrees/minute. Microstructures were imaged in a JEOL 6500 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated in the backscattered electron (BSE) mode.",[],['tbl1']
2.2,Methods and experimental procedures.Alloy preparation and characterization,"For the alloys selected for further studies of phase stability, recovery, recrystallization and grain growth, additional ingots measuring 12.7 mm × 25.4 mm × 127 mm were cast. The solidus temperatures of these solid solution alloys were measured using a NETZSCH 404 C differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). In this paper, the solidus temperatures are defined as the start temperature of the endothermic peaks observed on the DSC traces upon heating from room temperature to the melting temperature. The homogenized ingots were rolled at room temperature in steps from 12.7 mm to 1 mm (total thickness reduction of 92%) without cross-rolling or intermediate annealing. Specimens were then cut perpendicular to the rolling direction and annealed at temperatures between 300 and 1100 °C. After annealing, crystal structures and microstructures were analyzed as described previously.",[],[]
2.2,Methods and experimental procedures.Alloy preparation and characterization,"Grain growth kinetics were investigated at 900 °C and annealing times of 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 h. Pure Ni was excluded from the grain growth study because its starting grain size after 1 h was very large (∼130 μm) and was expected to grow to a significant fraction of the thickness of the rolled sheets (∼1000 μm) after longer annealing times. Grain size measurements were made on SEM BSE images of the alloy microstructures using the linear intercept method; at least 150 grains were counted for each specimen.",[],[]
2.2,Methods and experimental procedures.Alloy preparation and characterization,Microhardness was measured with a LECO LM 100ATVickers Hardness tester using a load of 500 g. Ten indents were made for each condition from which average values of hardness and standard deviations were calculated.,[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Phase identification and phase stability,"X-ray diffraction patterns and BSE images of the cast and homogenized alloys are shown inFigs. 2–4. Three of the five quaternaries, FeNiCoCr, FeNiCoMn and NiCoCrMn, five of the eight ternaries, FeNiCo, FeNiCr, FeNiMn, NiCoCr and NiCoMn, and two of the five binaries, FeNi and NiCo, exhibited only FCC peaks, while the XRD spectra of the others included peaks from other phase(s). The BSE micrographs shown for each alloy are consistent with their respective XRD patterns. In the case of FeCoMn, FeMn, NiMn, and CoMn, phase diagrams show that only an FCC phase should be present in these alloys at high temperatures (Table 1). However, their microstructures after homogenization and water quenching are not single-phase (Figs. 3and4) indicating that the high-temperature FCC phase is not stable at low temperatures.Fig. 1summarizes the above observations and identifies in red those materials that are single-phase FCC at room temperature after casting and homogenization. Starting from the quinary FCC-structured equiatomic alloy (FeNiCoCrMn), there are three quaternary, five ternary, and two binary equiatomic alloys that solidify as single-phase FCC solid solutions. Possible criteria for why some high-entropy alloys tend to solidify as a single-phase FCC solid solution while others tend to solidify as multiphase were proposed by Guo et al., including valence electron concentration (VEC)[25]and lattice distortion effects[26]. According to Guo et al.[25], when the effective VEC of an alloy is ≥8, it tends to form as single-phase FCC; for values between 6.87 and 8, it tends to form as two-phase FCC-BCC; and for values ≤6.87, it tends to form as single-phase BCC. To determine whether this is true in our equiatomic binaries, ternaries and quaternaries, we calculated their effective VECs using the elemental VECs given in Ref.[25]. We found that, except for two binaries (FeCo and NiMn), our alloys generally obey the VEC criterion of Guo et al.[25]. Their second criterion, based on lattice distortions[26], requires knowledge of the lattice parameters of our alloys, which is beyond the scope of the current study and will be taken up in a follow-on investigation. From these, we selected the FeNiCoCr quanternary and its ternary and binary subsets for further investigation.","['fig3', 'fig4', 'fig1', 'fig2', 'fig3', 'fig4']",['tbl1']
3.1,Results and discussion.Phase identification and phase stability,"Fig. 5shows XRD patterns and BSE images obtained from FeNiCoCr, FeNiCo, FeNiCr, NiCoCr, FeNi, and NiCo after cold rolling and annealing at 800 °C for 1 h. All of these alloys still exhibit only FCC peaks, except for the FeNiCr alloy, which exhibits additional peaks belonging to another phase. This second phase, which is present mainly on the grain boundaries, has the BCC structure based on our analysis of its XRD pattern and ternary phase diagram. Therefore, the FeNiCr alloy was excluded from further consideration since our focus here is on those alloys that are single-phase FCC after thermomechanical processing. The remainder of this paper deals with those materials (FeNiCoCr, FeNiCo, NiCoCr, FeNi, NiCo, and Ni) that were single-phase FCC after cold rolling and annealing for 1 h at temperatures of 300–1100 °C, as determined by XRD and microstructural analyses in a SEM. It is possible that some of these alloys (e.g., FeNi) might decompose into intermetallic phases if subjected to long-term, low-temperature anneals.",['fig5'],[]
3.2,"Results and discussion.Microstructural evolution during casting, homogenization, cold rolling and annealing","Fig. 6shows representative microstructures of the equiatomic FeNiCoCr alloy in the cast, homogenized, and recrystallized states. The as-cast specimen consists of large elongated grains extending from the edges to the center of the rectangular cross-section molds (Fig. 6a), consistent with the heat flow directions during solidification. After homogenization at 1200 °C for 24 h, the elongated grains near the center of the casting are replaced by more equiaxed grains (Fig. 6b). After cold rolling and annealing at 900 °C, the microstructure is fully recrystallized and comprised of equiaxed grains (Fig. 6c). A similar microstructural evolution was observed in the other alloys.Fig. 7shows the recrystallized microstructures of all the equiatomic alloys investigated here, along with that of pure Ni, after cold rolling and annealing at 1000 °C for 1 h. All of them exhibit equiaxed grains, but with different grain sizes and different numbers of annealing twins.","['fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig7']",[]
3.3,"Results and discussion.Recovery, recrystallization and grain growth kinetics","Microhardnesses after 1-h anneals at various temperatures are shown inFig. 8a. The open arrows indicate the start of recrystallization and the filled arrows the completion of recrystallization (TiandTfare the corresponding temperatures at which recrystallization starts and finishes, respectively). Note thatTiandTfare only approximate since our annealing temperatures had an increment of 100 °C.Fig. 8also includes, as representative examples, BSE images of the microstructures of the FeNiCo alloy: when annealed at 500 °C (belowTi), it exhibits a fully wrought microstructure (Fig. 8b); when annealed at 600 °C (Ti), it exhibits a partially recrystallized microstructure (Fig. 8c); and when annealed at 800 °C (Tf), it exhibits a fully recrystallized microstructure (Fig. 8d). The overall decrease in hardness with increasing temperature (Fig. 8a) is presumably the combined result of recovery, recrystallization and grain growth. A determination of the relative contributions of each of these processes to the hardness decrease would require more detailed analyses at finer temperature increments.","['fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8']",[]
3.3,"Results and discussion.Recovery, recrystallization and grain growth kinetics","As would be expected based on solute effects on strength, the smallest hardnesses were observed in pure nickel with the binaries having measurably higher hardnesses. However, the hardest material was not the quaternary but one of the ternaries (NiCoCr), indicating that the nature of the alloying elements has to be taken into account in addition to the sheer number of alloying elements.",[],[]
3.3,"Results and discussion.Recovery, recrystallization and grain growth kinetics","Table 2presents the temperatures at which melting commenced in the alloys, i.e., the solidus temperatures, based on the DSC measurements. For all the alloys shown inFig. 8a, the solidus temperatures lie in a relatively narrow range (1417–1462 °C). Therefore, the hardness differences seen inFig. 8a (related to the different temperature ranges for recovery, recrystallization and grain growth) are not due to differences in the homologous temperatures. Rather, they appear to be related to the nature of the specific elements present in the different alloys.","['fig8', 'fig8']",['tbl2']
3.3,"Results and discussion.Recovery, recrystallization and grain growth kinetics","Traditional notions of the effects of solutes on recovery, recrystallization and grain growth behavior can help us understand the differences seen inFig. 8, even though, in equiatomic alloys, unlike in more dilute solid solutions, there is no “solvent” into which solute atoms are added. Solute atoms can influence the stacking fault energy and/or impede the movement of dislocations[27]. Stacking fault energy (γSFE) is one of the most important parameters that determines the degree of recovery by affecting the extent to which dislocations dissociate, which in turn determines the rate of dislocation climb and cross slip, which are the mechanisms that usually control the rate of recovery[27]. In metals with low γSFEsuch as copper, climb is difficult, which slows down recovery[28]. On the other hand, in metals with high γSFEsuch as aluminum, climb is rapid, and the rate of recovery tends to be higher [e.g., Refs.[29,30]]. It has been shown that additions of Cr, Co, and Fe all lower the stacking fault energy of Ni, with iron having the smallest effect and Cr the largest[31,32]. Based on these results, one might expect the stacking fault energies of our materials to increase in the order: NiCoCr < FeNiCoCr < NiCo < FeNiCo < FeNi < Ni. The annealed microstructures shown inFig. 7, with different densities of annealing twins, are consistent with this trend of stacking fault energies. Thus, the relatively rapid decrease in the hardness of pure Ni can be attributed to its higher stacking fault energy while the slower decrease in some of the equiatomic alloys may be due to their lower stacking fault energies. Our experimental results are consistent with the work of Seymour and Harker[33], who found that there was no hardness reduction in the FeNi equiatomic alloy after a 1-h anneal at 500 °C but significant reduction after a 1-h anneal at 600 °C.","['fig8', 'fig7']",[]
3.3,"Results and discussion.Recovery, recrystallization and grain growth kinetics","Fig. 8also shows that the recrystallization start (Ti) and finish (Tf) temperatures depend on alloy composition. NiCo and Ni have similarTiandTftemperatures, which are significantly lower than those of FeNiCoCr, FeNiCo, NiCoCr and FeNi. Recrystallization temperatures usually vary inversely with the degree of cold work [e.g., Refs.[34,35]]. In the present study, all the materials investigated were subjected to the same degree of cold rolling (92% reduction in thickness); yet, as shown inFig. 8, they exhibited significantly different recrystallization temperatures. Thus, once again the specific nature of the alloying elements appears to be important.","['fig8', 'fig8']",[]
3.3,"Results and discussion.Recovery, recrystallization and grain growth kinetics","Fig. 9shows the mean grain size after 1-h anneals at various temperatures. With the exception that pure Ni exhibited both the largest grain size and the greatest amount of grain growth with annealing, there are no general trends in the observed behavior as a function of the number of elements in the alloy. The NiCoCr alloy had the smallest grain size at all annealing temperatures.",['fig9'],[]
3.3,"Results and discussion.Recovery, recrystallization and grain growth kinetics","Two of the alloys exhibited abnormal grain growth - pure Ni between 500 and 700 °C and FeNiCo at 800 °C. The short arrows inFig. 9point to the annealing temperatures at which abnormal grain growth was observed. An example of abnormal grain growth in pure Ni annealed at 500 °C for 1 h is shown in the inset BSE image inFig. 9, which shows the presence of a few large grains in a matrix of much smaller grains. All the other alloys showed normal grain growth at all temperatures, with a relatively narrow grain size distribution that evolved in a uniform fashion. Abnormal grain growth in alloys has been attributed to texture[36,37]or grain boundary pinning by precipitates[38]and can usually develop if certain boundaries are pinned more than others[39]. In high-purity bulk polycrystals and in specimens without texture, the occurrence of abnormal grain growth has been attributed to the segregation of impurity or solute atoms at grain boundaries[40–44]. Randle and Horton[45]observed anomalous grain growth in high-purity Ni for annealing temperatures lower than 0.68Tmbut relatively normal grain growth for higher temperature anneals. They attributed this to grain boundary structural transformations, which can lead to a change in the mobility of some grains boundaries and allow them to migrate at a faster rate than average. Lee et al.[46]further linked abnormal grain growth in pure Ni to the formation of faceted grain boundaries. Additional investigations are needed to determine whether any of these factors are responsible for the abnormal grain growth seen here in Ni and FeNiCo.","['fig9', 'fig9']",[]
3.3,"Results and discussion.Recovery, recrystallization and grain growth kinetics","The kinetics of grain growth are often analyzed according to the rate equation:(1)d1n−do1n=kt,wheredis the average grain size after annealing for timet,dois the average initial grain size,kis the rate constant andnis the grain growth exponent[47,48]. Whendois very small and a significant amount of grain growth has occurred (i.e.,d>>do), this expression can be simplified and written in its more usual form[49](2)d1n=kt,",[],[]
3.3,"Results and discussion.Recovery, recrystallization and grain growth kinetics","Burke and Turnbull[50]obtained a theoretical value ofn= 0.5 for the grain growth exponent, but many experimental studies have reported thatnis generally well below this value and that it varies with composition and temperature[27]. In fact, a grain growth exponent of 0.5 has rarely been found even in pure metals with very low impurity levels[27]. In our case, all the equiatomic alloys have a grain growth exponent close to 0.25 (Fig. 10), which is at the lower end of typical values reported in earlier studies on zone-refined metals where thenvalues ranged from 0.25 to 0.5[27]. To eliminate from consideration the very early stages of recrystallization and grain growth, the 1-h grain size data, although shown inFig. 10, were not considered in our estimation of the grain growth exponents. Values ofnless than 0.5 are often attributed to solute drag effects on the boundary mobility[51,52]. In the case of unalloyed Ni, a grain growth exponent close to 0.5 has in fact been reported[45].","['fig10', 'fig10']",[]
3.4,Results and discussion.Microhardness dependence on grain size,"Fig. 11shows the dependence of microhardness on mean grain size for the equiatomic alloys and pure Ni. The data indicate that the hardnesses all follow a Hall-Petch type relationship. As a consequence, the data inFig. 11can be fit to the expression(3)H=Ho+kHd−1/2,whereHis the hardness at a grain sized,Hois the hardness intercept atd−1/2= 0, andkH, the Hall-Petch slope, is a material parameter related to the grain boundary strength.","['fig11', 'fig11']",[]
3.4,Results and discussion.Microhardness dependence on grain size,"Table 3lists the Hall-Petch constants for the different alloys. In general, the Hall-Petch slopes follow the expected stacking fault energy trends discussed earlier. Fischmeister and Karlsson[53]noted that an increase in the value of the stacking fault energy decreases the Hall-Petch slope and attributed this effect to the easy formation of a cell structure, reasoning that cell boundaries, rather than grain boundaries, limit the slip lengths of dislocations in such cases. However, it is certainly possible that other factors control the behavior in these complex alloys.",[],['tbl3']
3.4,Results and discussion.Microhardness dependence on grain size,"At a given grain size, the hardness differences inFig. 11are a measure of the hardening effects of different solutes. Due to the large number of alloying elements in HE alloys, a high degree of solid solution hardening has been hypothesized in equiatomic multi-component alloys[1]. However, our results show that simply increasing the number of alloying elements does not always make the materials harder. For example, the addition of Co to pure Ni to form a binary, or to the FeNi alloy to produce a ternary, causes only minor hardening while the addition of Cr to NiCo and FeNiCo causes tremendous hardening. In other words, the nature of the added element also plays an important role in the hardening of equiatomic alloys. In general, the factors that affect solid solution hardening are size misfit, modulus mismatch, stacking fault energy changes, and long-range and/or short-range ordering. The magnitude of the elastic interaction force between a dislocation and a solute increases with both the atomic size and modulus misfits between solute and solvent atoms. In terms of the Seitz radii, the atomic sizes of Fe, Ni, Co, and Cr are 1.411, 1.377, 1.385, and 1.423 Å, respectively[54]. The largest difference in these atomic sizes is only 3.3%, suggesting that the difference in the hardness of the alloys is unlikely to be due to size misfits. In contrast, the Young's moduli of Fe, Ni, Co and Cr are 211, 200, 209, and 279 GPa, respectively[55], with the largest difference yielding a misfit 39.5% between Cr and Ni. Therefore, the observed hardening effects might be largely due to the modulus mismatch between Cr and the other elements, although it is difficult to extrapolate the general principles governing strength beyond the binary alloys.",['fig11'],[]
4,Summary and conclusions,"The high-entropy alloy FeNiCoCrMn has previously been shown to be single-phase FCC. All possible equiatomic subsystems (quaternary, ternary, and binary) of this quinary alloy were studied by assessing their available phase diagrams and experimentally verifying which of the sub-alloys formed single-phase FCC solid solutions. One of the single-phase quaternaries, FeNiCoCr, plus its equiatomic ternary and binary subsets that had the FCC crystal structure, were then selected for further investigations of phase stability, recovery, recrystallization and grain growth behavior. Pure Ni was also investigated to provide a baseline against which to compare the alloys. It was shown that neither the ability to form a single-phase solid solution, nor the degree of solid solution hardening, was determined solely by thenumberof alloying elements; rather thetypeof elements present in the alloys needs to be taken into account. Based on this study, the following conclusions can be drawn:(1)Three quaternaries, FeNiCoCr, FeNiCoMn, and NiCoCrMn, five ternaries, FeNiCo, FeNiCr, FeNiMn, NiCoCr, and NiCoMn, and two binaries, FeNi and NiCo, are single-phase FCC solid solutions in the cast and homogenized condition.(2)Among the FCC subsets of the FeNiCoCr alloy, phase separation occurs in one alloy, FeNiCr, when it is cold rolled and annealed (recrystallized), while all the others remain as single-phase FCC solid solutions.(3)FeNiCo and Ni exhibit abnormal grain growth at relatively low annealing temperatures while all the other alloys show normal grain growth behavior.(4)The grain growth exponents of the equiatomic alloys FeNiCoCr, FeNiCo, NiCoCr, FeNi, and NiCo are ∼0.25, compared to ∼0.5 for pure Ni, suggesting that solute drag may alter the grain growth kinetics of the equiatomic alloys.(5)All the equiatomic alloys as well as pure Ni show a Hall-Petch type of grain size dependence of microhardness.(6)The ternary equiatomic alloy NiCoCr is harder than all the other alloys, including the quaternary alloy FeNiCoCr, suggesting that solid solution hardening in multi-component equiatomic alloys cannot be solely determined by the number of alloying elements; the type of alloying elements is also important.",[],[]
