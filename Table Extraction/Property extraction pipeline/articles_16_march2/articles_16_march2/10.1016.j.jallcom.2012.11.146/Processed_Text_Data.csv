0,Abstract,"Inequi-atomic CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4 high entropy alloy has been designed and fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Alloying behavior, microstructure, phase evolution and mechanical properties of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4 alloy were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscope (TEM), as well as by an Instron testing system. During MA, a supersaturated solid solution consisting of a FCC phase and a metastable BCC phase was formed. Two FCC phases (named FCC1 and FCC2) and a new BCC phase were observed after SPS. During SPS, the metastable BCC phase transformed into the FCC2 phase and the new BCC phase. Meanwhile, the FCC1 phase was the initial FCC phase which was formed during MA. Moreover, nanoscale twins obviously presented only in partial FCC1 phase after SPS. Deformation twinning may be occurred during MA or SPS. The sintered alloy with a high relative density of 98.83% exhibits excellent comprehensive mechanical properties. The yield stress, compressive strength, compression ratio and Vickers hardness of the alloy are 2.08, 2.52GPa, 11.5% and 573 HV, respectively. The fracture mechanism of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4 high entropy alloy is mainly performed at intergranular fracture and plastic fracture mode.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"For primary properties and definite microstructures, one or two elements as principal components and other minor elements are always selected for metallic materials, e.g., Fe-, Al- and Mg-based alloys[1–3]. In general, as the amount of alloying elements increase, the formation of intermetallic compounds or other complicated phases typically takes place in the alloys due to the limited solid solubility. However, since 2004 these paradigms have been broken by high entropy alloys (HEAs) without one or two principal elements, these alloys predominantly have at least five major metallic elements and each of which has an atomic percentage between 5 and 35at.%[4,5]. Due to the entropic effects of mixing on solidification, HEAs could easily yield the formation of simple FCC and/or BCC structured solid solutions, as well as facilitating amorphization and nanoprecipitation[6–8]. The simple FCC and/or BCC solid solutions of HEAs are conductive to presenting a higher work hardening capacity and better plasticity at room temperature compared with intermetallics and bulk metallic glass alloys (BMGs). The investigated HEAs reveal that HEAs possess versatile and excellent properties, such as high hardness, high strength, good oxidation and corrosion resistance, and high-temperature softening resistance, which are beneficial in potential engineering applications[9–11].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"So far a substantial amount of HEAs have been systemically investigated, especially the alloys prepared by vacuum arc melt casting. Unfortunately, HEAs fabricated by vacuum arc melt casting method have limited shapes and sizes. Thus, many different approaches for the syntheses of HEAs have been developed. As a processing route for the synthesis of HEAs, mechanical alloying (MA) has been reported by several literatures recently[5,12–14]. In this paper, the consolidation of the as-milled powder was performed by spark plasma sintering (SPS) which could rapidly consolidate powders to high density by applying pressure and passing electric pulse current within short soaking time[15]. The CoNiFeCrAlxTi and CoNiFeCrAlTix(in atomic proportion) systems are two typical HEA systems, and their phase constitution and integrated mechanical properties can be accurately adjusted by controlling the Al and Ti addition[16,17]. Al and Ti with larger atomic radius than other constituent elements can have better solid solution strengthening effects. As a result, high strength and high hardness were obtained with increasing concentration of Al or Ti, but the plasticity of these two HEA systems dropped significantly. Hence, considering all the factors discussed above, CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy in this paper was designed and fabricated by SPS of the as-milled powder with the aim to achieve optimum properties. Alloying behavior and phase evolution during the MA process and after densification by SPS were comprehensively studied. Microstructure and mechanical properties after SPS were investigated.",[],[]
2,Experiment details,"CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4(in atomic proportion) high entropy alloy was prepared by 45h dry milling of mixed elemental powders. The 45h milled alloy powder was subsequently wet ball milled 4h with alcohol as the milling media. Elemental powders Co, Fe, Ni, Cr, Al and Ti with high purity (>99.9wt.%) and particle size of ⩽45μm (325mesh) were processed by mechanical alloying. The mechanical alloying process was carried out in a high performance stainless steel vial into which the powders were sealed together with tungsten carbide balls (5mm in diameter) under an Ar atmosphere. The sealed vial was then fitted in a high energy planetary ball milling machine (QM-3SP2 Planetary Ball Mill) at 300rpm. The ball to powder weight ratio was 10:1. Ball milled powder was then consolidated by SPS (Dr. Sinter 825, Sumitomo Coal Mining Co., Ltd., Japan) in a 20.4mm-inner-diameter graphite die at 1000°C for 8min. Sintering was performed under vacuum (residual cell pressure <8Pa) with a constant compression pressure of 30MPa. For easy removal and significant reduction of temperature inhomogeneities, 0.2mm thick graphite foils were placed between the punches and the powders, and between the die and the powders, respectively. For all the sintering, the samples were heated to 600°C within 4min. From 600 to 900°C and from 900 to 1000°C, heating rates of 75 and 50°Cmin−1were used, respectively.",[],[]
2,Experiment details,"A Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer (XRD) with a Cu Kα radiation was used for the analysis of the milled powders and phase evolution after sintering. Microstructural analysis was employed by a Zeiss Supra 40 (Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH, Germany) scanning electron microscope (SEM). For the microstructure observation, the samples were polished and then etched with aqua regia solution. Thin-foil specimens were prepared by mechanical thinning followed by ion milling at room temperature and were observed under a transmission electron microscope (200kV TEM, JEM-2100, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) analysis. The thermal analysis was carried out in a NETZSCH STA 449C differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) at a heating rate of 10K/min under flowing high purity argon atmosphere. The ambient temperature mechanical properties were evaluated by uniaxial compression tests on samples ofΦ3×4.5mm by using an Instron 5500 testing system with a strain rate of 1×10−3s−1. Three compression tests were performed to obtain average value. Hardness measurement was carried out on the consolidated samples at a load of 300gf in Digital Micro Hardness Tester HVS-1000 Vickers hardness instrument. The reported hardness value was an average of at least 10 measurements.",[],[]
3.1,Results.XRD analysis during MA and after SPS," Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy powder with different milling time. Diffraction patterns of all the pure elements are evidently observed in the primitive mixture (0h). It is clear that drastic decrement of diffraction intensity is observed when the milling is prolonged. Most of the diffraction peaks can hardly be seen and the peaks of both Co and Al elements dissolve most rapidly when the milling time reaches 6h. As the milling time extends to 15h, only one peak which is associated with Ni and Ti disappears. Essentially disappearance of most of the elemental peaks indicates that the formation of complete solid solution occurs within 30h of milling. Predominant peaks of both BCC phase and FCC phase are observed. In order to achieve refined and homogeneous solid solution, the milling time was extended to 45h. The diffraction peaks show no distinct change except for a minor broadening after ball milling for 45h. In addition, to achieve fine metallic powder for being conducive to sintering, the 45h ball milled powder was subjected to wet ball milling in ethanol for 4h. A significant increment of diffraction intensity with a minor broadening is visible after the powder was grinded for 49h.",['f0005'],[]
3.1,Results.XRD analysis during MA and after SPS,"Based on Scherrer’s formula (the instrumental contribution is eliminated), the crystalline size and lattice strain of the BCC and FCC phases with different milling time have been calculated from the X-ray peak broadening. The calculated results are listed in Table 1 . Apparently, the crystalline sizes of both BCC and FCC phases are significantly refined as the milling time prolongs. In contrast, the lattice strain of these two phases increase gradually when the milling time extends to 49h. The crystalline size of the BCC phase is 11nm after 45h of milling while 10nm as the milling time prolongs to 49h, which demonstrates that the equilibrium of crystalline refinement and cold welding of BCC phase has been achieved when the milling time reaches 45h. The crystalline size of the BCC phase cannot be further refined with increased milling duration. However, the crystalline size of the FCC phase can still be further refined after 45h of milling.",[],['t0005']
3.1,Results.XRD analysis during MA and after SPS," Fig. 2 illustrates the XRD pattern of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy after densification by SPS at 1000°C. It suggests that the bulk alloy consolidated after SPS consists of a main FCC phase and a minor BCC phase. However, judging from the relative intensity in Fig. 1 , the main phase of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy powder after 49h of milling are the BCC and FCC phases. Hence, it could be postulated that partial BCC phase transforms into FCC phase after SPS.","['f0010', 'f0005']",[]
3.2,Results.Microstructure and phase analysis after SPS," Fig. 3 shows the SEM micrographs of bulk CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy consolidated by SPS. The bulk alloy achieves a high relative density up to 98.83% which is calculated with respect to actual density and theoretical density. Low magnified image ( Fig. 3(a) ) shows that the surface morphology of bulk CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy obviously includes two distinctive kinds of areas, viz., irregular bulk areas and pothole areas. Ultrafine porosity is observed in high magnified image clearly. High magnified image exhibits that some nanoscale phases are dispersed in irregular pothole areas. In conclusion, bulk CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy might possess at least three types of phases.","['f0015', 'f0015']",[]
3.2,Results.Microstructure and phase analysis after SPS," Fig. 4 shows the TEM bright field image and corresponding SAED patterns of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy after SPS. Fig. 4(a)  shows bright field TEM micrograph of the bulk alloy. The phases of the alloy are not easily identified by contrast in bright field image. Crystal structures and chemical compositions (in at.%) of the phases in CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4alloy (regions A–Z as marked in Fig. 4(a) ) are measured by EDS/TEM. The corresponding SAED patterns of these phases are shown from Fig. 4(b)  to (e). Based on the chemical composition analysis results, all of the regions can be classified as three different phases as shown in Table 2 . The [011] zone axis diffraction pattern of region E (in Fig. 4(b) ) displays a typical FCC structure. The corresponding [112] zone axis diffraction pattern of region B (in Fig. 4(b) ) also confirms a FCC structure. In contrast, the corresponding [158] zone axis diffraction pattern of region V (in Fig. 4(b) ) with white contrast shows a BCC crystal structure. To differentiate these three phases, they are termed FCC1, FCC2 and BCC hereinafter. The chemical composition analysis results are given in Table 2 . Regions B, C, F, L, U, Q, R and S belong to the FCC1 phase, while region V belongs to the BCC phase. The remnant regions belong to the FCC1 phase. In addition, diffraction pattern of region A (in Fig. 4(b) ) exhibits a FCC twin structure of the FCC1 phase. However, typical microstructure of twins is not clearly in region A (in Fig. 4(b) ). Clear microstructures and corresponding SAED patterns of twins will be illustrated hereinafter. According to Table 2 , the FCC1 phase is Al-depleted, Ti-depleted, Fe-rich and Cr-rich compared with the nominal composition of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy. The FCC2 phase is Al-rich, Ni-rich and Ti-rich, while Fe-depleted and Cr-depleted. The BCC phase is Ti and especially Al in rich. It is noticeable that the grain sizes of most these phases are not more than 500nm from Fig. 4(a) , showing a wide distribution ranging from tens of nanometers to approximately 500nm. The grain size of the FCC1 phase is slightly larger than the FCC2 phase. The BCC phase with white contrast is much finer than these two FCC phases. Moreover, most of the BCC phase is nanoscale in size which agrees well with the nanoscale phases in Fig. 3(b) . It is of interest that the XRD pattern of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy reveals only one FCC crystal structure. The lattice parameters of these three phases as measured by SAED are 3.7251Å (FCC1), 3.7250Å (FCC2) and 13.3632Å, respectively. These calculated results can better account for the only one FCC crystal structure is characterized in Fig. 2 , because these two FCC phases nearly have the same lattice parameter which could not be accurately and conspicuously distinguished by the Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer.As mentioned above, twinned FCC1 phase is observed. Fig. 5 shows TEM images and corresponding SAED patterns of the FCC1 phase with nanoscale twins. It is worth pointing out that nanoscale twins present only in the FCC1 phase, which has been verified by EDS/TEM and the corresponding diffraction patterns. Fig. 5(a)  illustrates two adjacent FCC1 structure grains with inside nanoscale twins. The lamella thickness of the nanoscale twins exhibits a distribution ranging from several nanometers to 50nm. The corresponding SAED pattern (the matrix axis is [011]Mand the twin axis is[01¯1¯]T) is shown in the inset of the upper right of Fig. 5(a) , demonstrating these inside nanoscale twins belong to the phase with FCC1 structure. Similar nanoscale twins are shown in Fig. 5(b) , nevertheless, the lamella thickness of the inside nanoscale twins is not more than 45nm. Furthermore, the volume fraction of the FCC1 phase with nanoscale twins is smaller than 10%.","['f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0015', 'f0010', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025']","['t0010', 't0010', 't0010']"
3.3,Results.Mechanical properties," Fig. 6 shows the stress–strain curve of bulk CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy after SPS under compression at ambient temperature. The yield strength (σy), compressive strength (σmax) and compression ratio (εp) of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4alloy are 2.08, 2.52GPa and 11.5%, respectively. The average value of the Vickers hardness of bulk CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4alloy is 573Hv. Moreover, plastic deformation behavior is also characterized in the stress–strain curve. The mechanical properties of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy and CoNiFeCrAlTi high entropy alloy processed by different methods are listed elaborately in Table 3 . Compressive properties of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4alloy are slightly superior to CoFeNiCrAlTi high entropy alloy prepared by copper mold casting (with a diameter of 5mm). As compared to CoFeNiCrAlTi alloy processed by arc-melting, the compressive strength of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4alloy has enhanced by 10.5% with an increment of compression ratio by 79.7%. In addition, Zhang et al. synthesized CoNiFeCrAlTi high entropy alloy by SPS of the as-milled powder[18], however, the Vickers hardness of this alloy is merely 432Hv. The Vickers hardness of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4has increased by 32.6% compared with CoNiFeCrAlTi high entropy alloy prepared by Zhang et al.",['f0030'],['t0015']
3.3,Results.Mechanical properties," Fig. 7 shows two typical fracture morphologies for CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy. In Fig. 7(a) , dimples are visible on the fracture surface and intergranular fracture feature is characterized predominantly in compound fracture morphology. Fig. 7(b)  shows slip lines and point-like adhesions. Moreover, some particles are evidently observed on the fracture surface, it could be postulated that these particles correspond to nanoscale phase observed in the SEM ( Fig. 3(b) ) and TEM ( Fig. 4(a) ) images. In addition, it is clear that the particles are not combined firmly with the matrix in Fig. 7(a) . In summary, the fracture mechanism of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy is concluded to be intergranular fracture and plastic fracture, and intergranular fracture is the main fracture mechanism.","['f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0015', 'f0020', 'f0035']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Explanation for phase formation and evolution,"Both Al and Co dissolve most rapidly during the MA process, which is caused by their lower melting point than other elements in CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy system. Chen et al. found that the order of decreasing alloying rate correlates best with the melting points of the elements during MA, revealing that elements with lower melting point dissolve more rapidly[6]. As the milling time increases, drastic decrement of diffraction intensity is possibly attributed to high lattice strain, decreased crystallinity and refined crystal size[18,19]. Furthermore, when the milling time is prolonged, the peak disappearance is mainly associated with the formation of solid solution, lattice distortion and refinement of crystallite size[12]. Due to the conspicuously refined nanocrystalline and high lattice strain (are shown in Table 1 ), the diffraction peaks exhibit no change except for a minor broadening and an appreciable increment of diffraction intensity when milled hour reaches up to 49h. During MA, the circulation of crushment and agglomeration introduced by severe plastic deformation can lead to refinement of crystallite size. The calculated results in Table 1 indicate that the lattice strain of the solid solution with both BCC and FCC structures increases gradually as the milling time prolongs. With the milling duration increasing, the volume fraction of grain boundaries and plastic deformation are continuously increased owing to the refinement of grain size. As a result, the increment in lattice strain occurs. In addition, size mismatch effect between the constituents and increasing dislocation density introduced by intensive mechanical deformation also can facilitate the increment of lattice strain[12,20].",[],"['t0005', 't0005']"
4.1,Discussion.Explanation for phase formation and evolution,"In Fig. 1 , it is of interest that all other elements appear to be dissolving into Fe and/or Cr peaks as the milling time increases during the MA process. Generally speaking, BCC crystal structure is an open structure while FCC structure is a close packed structure. Thus, FCC structure may not be able to accommodate other elements without lattice expansion while BCC may accommodate other elements with a little expansion and much more easily. Hence, all other elements are observed to be dissolving into Fe and/or Cr which possess open BCC crystal structure[14].",['f0005'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Explanation for phase formation and evolution,"The formation of simple solid solution with both BCC and FCC crystal structure is complicated. Firstly, the circulation of crushment and agglomeration during the MA process plays a vital role in the formation of simple solid solution[4]. The mixing enthalpy of atom-pairs in Table 4 clearly shows that the mixing enthalpy of most of the atomic pairs possesses high negative entropy. However, only atomic pair with mixing entropy near zero can exhibit high solid solubility under equilibrium condition[23]. But in the present paper, a complete solid solution which can be defined as supersaturated solid solution formed within 30h of milling. This phenomenon is due to the solid solubility extension produced by the non-equilibrium state of the MA process. What is more, alloying behavior takes place with the crystalline refined to be nanocrystalline. A large amount of enthalpy can be stored in the large volume fraction of grain boundaries which is resulted from nanocrystalline. Thus, the driving force originated from the energy which is stored in the grain boundaries is another crucial factor for the formation of solid solution. In addition, random diffusion between different elements in this hexahydroxy alloy system could be enhanced because of its high entropy of mixing, which might contribute to the solid solubility extension.",[],['t0020']
4.1,Discussion.Explanation for phase formation and evolution,"Yeh et al.[4]has proposed that it is possible to form simple solid solutions when HEAs have five or more than five elements due to their high entropy of mixing. Based on this proposition, the high entropy of mixing (whenΔSmix⩾1.61R,Ris the gas constant) lowers the tendency to segregate and order, which can facilitate the formation of solid solution more easily than the formation of intermetallics and other ordered phases. Unfortunately high entropy of mixing is insufficient to explain some alloys (whenΔSmix<1.61R) which can also form simple solid solutions with FCC and/or BCC structure(s)[24]. Subsequently, according to the calculation of most of reported HEAs, Yang et al.[25]proposed that simple crystal structures of HEAs are formed whenΛ⩾1.1 andδ⩽6.6%, hereΛis defined as a parameter of the entropy of mixing timing the average melting temperature of the elements over the enthalpy of mixing,δis the mean square deviation of the atomic size of elements.

4.1,Discussion.Explanation for phase formation and evolution," Fig. 2 shows that partial BCC phase transforms into a FCC phase after SPS. According to the analysis results of TEM image and corresponding SAED patterns, the FCC2 phase is finer than the FCC1 phase, suggesting partial BCC phase transforms into the FCC2 phase after SPS. Furthermore, most of the BCC phase with white contrast after SPS is nanoscale in size, which is possibly transformed from the initial BCC phase after ball milled for 49h. The phase evolution during SPS could be attributed to the metastable state of the supersaturated solid solution. The BCC phase is possible a metastable BCC structure after MA. Therefore, the metastable BCC structure phase transforms into stable equilibrium phases in the final stage of sintering. Moreover, the lattice strain of the supersaturated solid solution reduces drastically indicates that defects produced during the MA process are nearly annihilated after sintering. It means that the phase transformation during SPS is also caused by reordering due to the annihilation of defects generated from serve plastic deformation during MA[14]. To deeply investigate the phase evolution procedure, subsequently, the thermal analysis was employed in a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) with a temperature range of 25–1200°C. Fig. 8 illustrates DSC curve of CoFeNiCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy powder after 49h of milling. The long exothermic line from 25 to 627.5°C is related to the release of lattice strain and structural deformation. Obvious endothermic peak is observed at 627.5°C. The energy absorption might be consistent with the phase evolution to form the FCC1 phase and another BCC during the SPS process. An exothermic peak is approximately at 958.5°C, which can be associated with the energy release of phase transformation.","['f0010', 'f0040']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Assumptions for deformation twinning,"As mentioned hereinabove, it is interesting that nano-sized twins present only in the FCC1 phase after SPS. Deformation twinning might occur during MA or SPS. Therefore, there are two assumed forming mechanisms for deformation twinning.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Assumptions for deformation twinning,"Assumption I hypothesizes that deformation twinning occurred during the MA process. Fig. 9 describes the schematic diagram of assumption I for deformation twinning. Fig. 9(a)  shows that partial nanoscale FCC phase is twinned during MA. Deformation twinning in nanocrystalline FCC Al powder and Al–Zn–Mg–Cu alloy powder via ball milling in liquid nitrogen has been reported[26–28]. Apparently, Al–Zn–Mg–Cu alloy powder and Al powder could be severely plastically deformed during the MA process, thus high density dislocations were produced. Three twinning mechanisms were predicted by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and subsequently were verified by experimental observations in nanocrystalline FCC Al powder, i.e., twin lamella formation via the dissociation and migration of grain boundary (GB) segments, heterogeneous nucleation and growth from GBs, and homogeneous nucleation of twins inside grains by the dynamic overlapping of stacking faults[26,27,29]. In nanocrystalline Al–Zn–Mg–Cu alloy powder synthesized by cryomilling, deformation twinning was induced by the climbing of the restricted dislocations in nanoscale grains due to high strain during the cryomilling process[28]. In the present paper, serve deformation occurred during MA. In addition, the nanoscale FCC phase has higher lattice strain ( Table 1 ) than the nanoscale BCC phase during MA, which might imply that twinning capability of the FCC phase is larger compared with the that of BCC phase. Actually, the study on deformation twinning of nanocrystalline materials has been largely focused on FCC crystal structure metals while nanomaterials with BCC crystal structure have not been studied much, which might attribute to large capability of deformation twinning in nanocrystalline FCC crystal structure metals[30]. Thus, we assumed that twins presented only in partial FCC phase during MA. During the SPS process, transformation of the metastable BCC phase into the FCC2 phase and a new BCC phase occurred simultaneously with growth of grains and densification. As discussed proceeding, the FCC1 phase is from the initial FCC phase of the MA process. Fig. 9(b)  illustrates the schematic diagram of assumption I for deformation twinning after SPS, revealing nanoscale twins presented only in partial FCC1 phase are obviously originated from partial FCC phase of the MA process.","['f0045', 'f0045', 'f0045']",['t0005']
4.2,Discussion.Assumptions for deformation twinning,"Assumption II hypothesizes that deformation twins formed under a constant pressure of 30MPa at 1000°C during the SPS process. In general, high strain rate and low deformation temperature can promote deformation twinning, especially deformation twinning of metals and alloys with FCC crystal structure is largely associated with low stacking fault energy[31]. When a metal or alloy is plastically deformed at relatively high temperatures, significant deformation mechanisms are grain rotation, grain boundary sliding and diffusion, especially for the large grain size. However, as to small grain size, deformation mechanisms of ultrafine materials and nanomaterials are different from those in their coarse-grained counterparts. It should be noted that deformation twinning mechanisms of ultrafine materials and nanomaterials are much more complicated and unique. Several literatures have been reported that deformation twinning could occur at high temperatures[31–33]. Fig. 10 shows schematic diagram of assumption II for deformation twinning. Fig. 10(a)  exhibits that a solid solution possesses a FCC and a BCC phase without deformation twins after 49h ball milling. During the SPS process, the metastable BCC phase transformed into the FCC2 phase and a new BCC phase, meanwhile, the FCC1 phase was from the initial FCC phase of the MA process. Deformation twinning occurred in partial FCC1 phase simultaneously with phase evolution during the SPS process. Schematic diagram of assumption II for deformation twinning is shown in Fig. 10(b) .","['f0050', 'f0050', 'f0050']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Assumptions for deformation twinning,"Deformation twinning mechanism in partial FCC1 phase is relatively complex. Resolved shear stress used for forming twins in solid solution alloys is lower compared with their pure counterparts, because solid solution strengthening permits these flow stress level to be achieved at early strain levels giving more chance for twins to happen[34]. Solid solution strengthening could be readily achieved in CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy owning to Al and Ti with large atomic radius. The FCC1 phase which is from the initial FCC phase of the MA process displays high lattice strain promoting deformation twinning[31]. In addition, obvious white phase (BCC after SPS) is dispersed on twinned FCC1 phase grain boundaries (see Fig. 5 ), demonstrating the white phase might have affect on deformation twinning. The white phase distributing on twinned FCC1 phase grain boundaries can improve deformation resistance of grain boundaries which results in impeding grain boundary sliding. On the other hand, the alloyed CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4powder with a hard brittle texture could not be deformed and consolidated readily even at 1000°C during centering, which is attributed to excellent high temperature softening resistance of HEAs[4]. In conclusion, deformation twinning only in partial FCC1 phase took place simultaneously with phase evolution during the SPS process.",['f0025'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Assumptions for deformation twinning,"In summary, assumption I envisages deformation twinning occurring during MA, in contrast, assumption II assumes deformation twinning occurring during SPS. Unfortunately high resolution transmission electron microscope (HREM) observations have not been successfully subjected to verify these two assumptions which one is correct. Because CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy exhibits unique ferromagnetism which limits its HREM observations, especially limiting the detection of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy powder by HREM. Hence, further study is needed to understand the deformation twinning mechanism in partial FCC1 phase.",[],[]
4.3,Discussion.Strengthening mechanisms,"According to Table 3 , bulk CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy exhibits excellent mechanical properties. The excellent mechanical properties can be attributed to the effect of nanoscale twins, solid solution strengthening and appropriate concentrations of all constituent elements. Table 4 suggests that Al and Ti have larger atomic radius than other elements in this alloy system. Al and Ti with larger atomic radius occupy the lattice sites, resulting in increasing appreciably the lattice distortion energy and finally enhancing the effect of solid solution strengthening[16]. Unlike conventional strengthening mechanisms[35–37], complicated interaction between nanoscale twin boundaries and dislocations will inevitably affect mechanical properties of bulk CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy. Nanoscale twin boundaries are strong barriers for dislocation motion, thus nanoscale twin boundaries are considered to be equivalent to traditional grain boundaries with respect to the Hall–Petch (H–P) effect[38,39]. Besides dislocations pile-up on twin boundaries, CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4with naono-sized twins should be strengthened via single dislocation transmission across twin boundaries which act as strong barriers for the transmission of dislocations[30]. As a result, nanoscale twins can significantly improve the strength, hardness and plasticity of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy[40]. In addition, ultrafine and nanosized grain sizes can also strengthen CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy. As these discussed factors and strengthening mechanisms, excellent comprehensive mechanical properties of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy have been achieved.",[],"['t0015', 't0020']"
5,Conclusions,"CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy has been successfully prepared via MA and SPS. A supersaturated solid solution with both FCC and BCC structures is evidently observed after MA. During the SPS process, the metastable BCC phase transforms into a new BCC phase with white contrast in TEM images and a FCC phase (named FCC2 phase), while the FCC1 phase is the initial FCC phase of the MA process. After SPS, the grain size of the FCC1 phase showing a wide distribution ranging from tens of nanometers to approximately 500nm is larger than the FCC2 phase. Most of the BCC phase with white contrast is nanosacle in size. Nanoscale deformation twins present only in partial FCC1 phase after SPS. Two assumptions are proposed to explain deformation twinning. Assumption I envisages deformation twinning occurring during the MA process, in contrast, assumption II assumes deformation twinning occurring during the SPS process. CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy displays excellent comprehensive mechanical properties due to the effect of nanoscale twins and solid solution strengthening, as well as appropriate concentrations of all constituent elements. The fracture mechanism of CoNiFeCrAl0.6Ti0.4high entropy alloy is concluded to be intergranular fracture and plastic fracture, and the fracture mechanism is dominated by intergranular fracture.",[],[]
