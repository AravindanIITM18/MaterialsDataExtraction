    "1. The context section contains definitions of various properties of materials commonly found in the literature of materials science. The table section contains a table caption and a table. Your task is to identify the properties from the context section that are described in the table. If no property from the context section is described in the table, reply with a '-'. \n",

If one more properties from the context section is present in the table return a table in CSV format that contains the alloy composition, processing condition(if available in the table), testing condition(if available in the table) the property present in table(as written in the context section), property value and units as present in the table provided.\n",
    "3. Note that the table may contain the same property as in the context but with a different naming convention. Use the context to understand the property and decide if any property from the context is described in the table. If some property is mentioned with a heading that you are unsure of from the context provided, do not extract that property. Extract only those properties available in the context.\n",
    "3. Refer to the examples and follow the above instructions strictly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Context:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS):\n",
    "Definition: UTS is the maximum stress a material can withstand before breaking, measured during a tensile test. The test can be done \n",
    "Units: Pascals (Pa), megapascals (MPa), or pounds per square inch (psi).\n",
    "Comparison: UTS is always higher than yield strength since it represents the material's maximum capacity to resist tension before fracture.\n",
    "Variations: Often called tensile strength or breaking strength.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Yield Strength:\n",
    "Definition: Yield strength is the stress at which a material begins to deform plastically.\n",
    "Units: Pascals (Pa), megapascals (MPa), or pounds per square inch (psi).\n",
    "Comparison: Yield strength is always less than UTS, as plastic deformation starts at lower stress levels.\n",
    "Variations: Also referred to as yield stress, elastic limit stress, or stress at the elastic limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Ductility:\n",
    "Definition: Ductility is the material's ability to undergo significant plastic deformation before rupture.\n",
    "Units: Dimensionless or percentage values, such as percent elongation (%EL) or percent reduction in area (%RA).\n",
    "Comparison: Higher ductility indicates a material can deform more without breaking. Brittle materials have very low ductility.\n",
    "Variations: Sometimes called fracture strain or elongation at break.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hardness:\n",
    "Definition: Hardness is a material’s resistance to deformation or penetration by an indenter under an applied load.\n",
    "Units: Scientifically measured in units of GPa but no universal unit, often expressed using specific test scales like Vickers (HV), Rockwell (HRC), Brinell (BH), or Mohs hardness.\n",
    "Comparison: Harder materials resist localized deformation better but may lack ductility.\n",
    "Variations:\n",
    "Microhardness: Measured using small loads to assess localized properties (e.g., Vickers or Knoop microhardness).\n",
    "Nano-hardness: Assessed using nano-indentation techniques, useful for thin films and coatings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Wear Resistance:\n",
    "Definition: Wear resistance is a material's ability to resist surface damage or material loss due to mechanical action such as friction, abrasion, or erosion.\n",
    "Units: No standard unit; it is often described qualitatively or measured by volume loss (e.g., mm³) during wear tests.\n",
    "Comparison: Materials with high hardness often exhibit better wear resistance, though this also depends on other factors like toughness and lubrication.\n",
    "Variations:\n",
    "Abrasion resistance: Focused on resistance to scratching or scuffing.\n",
    "Erosion resistance: Focused on material loss due to particles or fluids impacting the surface.\n",
    "\n",
