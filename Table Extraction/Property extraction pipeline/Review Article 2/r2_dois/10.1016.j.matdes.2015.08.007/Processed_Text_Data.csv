The Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12 and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18 alloys were ductile single phase fcc solid solutions. The Fe40Mn28Ni8Cr24 alloy had intermetallic sigma phase matrix and was extremely brittle after homogenization. The tensile properties of the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12 and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18 solid solution alloys were examined in recrystallized condition with average grain size of ~10μm. The yield strength increased from 210MPa of the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4 alloy to 310MPa of the Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18 alloy. The elongation to fracture of the alloys decreased from 71% to 54%, respectively. Solid solution strengthening by the constitutive elements of the alloys was calculated using Labush approach. Strong solid solution strengthening by Cr was predicted.

1,Introduction,"The high entropy alloys (HEAs)[1]are multicomponent alloys composed of at least 5 principle elements with nearly equiatomic concentrations from 5 to 35at.% according to original definition[2]. The HEAs concept has been developed recently with intent on stabilization of complexly concentrated random solid solution phases by high mixing entropy. Later it was revealed that many of HEAs can have complex multiphase structure and mixing entropy is not the principal factor governing phase formation in HEAs[3–5]. However, some of the equiatomic HEAs have been proved to have either fcc or bcc solid solution single phase structures. The single fcc phase CoCrFeNiMn alloy[6]has remarkable mechanical properties: good ductility at room and cryogenic temperatures[7]and exceptional fracture toughness at cryogenic temperature[8]. Similarity of mechanical behavior of the CoCrFeNiMn alloy with high-Mn austenitic TWIP steels was pointed out[9]. Potential application of the alloy as energy-absorbing material was suggested[9]. But the CoCrFeNiMn alloy has rather low yield strength in recrystallized condition[7]. The decrease of grain size[7]or cold working[10]can promote significant hardening, but at a cost of (drastic in case of cold working) reduce of ductility[7,10].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Strength of the Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn system alloys can be possibly increased by optimizing chemical composition. Complexly concentrated solid solutions are expected to benefit from strong solid-solution strengthening (SSS) caused by massive alloying[1]. Increased concentration of elements having strong SSS effect, i.e., development of non-equiatomic HEAs[11–13], can have positive effect on mechanical performance of the alloys. However, only limited effects have been made so far to qualify SSS effect in HEAs[14–16]. This limits the possibilities of tailoring composition of the alloys to maximize SSS effect. Analysis of mechanical properties of the various ternary and quaternary equiatomic alloys in the Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn system suggests that Cr has the strongest strengthening effect among the constitutive elements of the alloys[17]. Therefore, in current study, we have examined mechanical properties of the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18, 24 (at.%)) alloys with different Cr and Ni contents. The number and concentrations of the constitutive elements in the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys don't fit the HEAs definition, but the alloys are not based on single principal element and therefore are defined as multicomponent alloys. Co was excluded due to its high cost and potentially unfavorable effect on radiation damage performance[18]. Two main aims were pursued: (i) to experimentally establish possibility of controlling mechanical properties of single phase multicomponent alloys by appropriate alloying, (ii) to evaluate possibility of predicting SSS effect in multicomponent alloys.",[],[]
2,Methods,"In this study, a series of Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18, 24 (at.%)) alloys was studied. All the compositions given in the text are also in at.%. The alloys were produced by vacuum arc melting of the high-purity (at least 99.9%) constitutive elements. The produced ingots had dimensions of ≈8×12×40mm3. Each ingot was remelted at least 5 times to ensure chemical homogeneity. The produced ingots were homogenized at 1000°C for 24h in vacuum. SEM-EDX analysis showed that actual chemical composition of the alloys corresponded to nominal ones (Table 1). After homogenization, the alloys were cold rolled with ≈80% height reduction. However, the Fe40Mn28Ni8Cr24alloy was found to be extremely brittle and fractured at the initial stages of rolling. Therefore the Fe40Mn28Ni8Cr24alloy was excluded from further processing. The Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloys were successfully rolled without any noticeable cracking. The cold rolled alloys were further annealed at 850°C for 30min to produce recrystallized structure.",[],['t0005']
2,Methods,"Microstructure and phase composition of the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18, 24 (at.%)) alloys were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques. The XRD analysis was performed using RIGAKU diffractometer and Cu Kα radiation. Samples for SEM observations were prepared by careful mechanical polishing. SEM investigations were performed utilizing Quanta 200 3D microscope equipped with back-scattered electron (BSE) and energy-dispersive (EDS) detectors.",[],[]
2,Methods,"Vickers microhardness of the homogenized Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18, 24 (at.%)) alloys was measured using a 250g load applied for 15s. 20 measurements were made for each alloy. Dog-bone specimens with gauge dimensions of 1.5×3×5mm3for tensile testing were cut using electric discharge machine from the as-annealed Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloys. Prior to testing, specimens were carefully mechanically polished. Testing to fracture was performed at constant crosshead speed of 1mm/min in an Instron 5882 test machine. Elongation to fracture was determined by measurements of spacing between marks designating the gauge length before and after the test.",[],[]
3,Results,"Figs. 1 and 2demonstrate respectively XRD patterns and SEM-BSE images of the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18, 24) alloys. The results of the local EDX chemical analysis of the alloys are shown inTable 1. The XRD patterns of the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloys after rolling and subsequent annealing (Fig. 1) demonstrate the presence of diffraction peaks from single fcc phase. The lattice parameter of fcc phase is not affected significantly by Cr and Ni content and is of 3.611–3.612nm. The SEM images of the microstructure of the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloys (Fig. 2a–c) confirm single phase structure of the alloys. The average size of recrystallized grains is 12.9±3.2μm, 8.9±2.2μm and 8.1±2.5μm respectively in the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloys. Numerous annealing twins are found inside the grains. The chemical composition of the grains is identical to the composition of the corresponding alloy.","['f0010', 'f0015', 'f0010', 'f0015']",['t0005']
3,Results,"The XRD pattern of the homogenized Fe40Mn28Ni8Cr24alloy (Fig. 1) reveals the presence of two phases — tetragonal sigma phase and fcc phase. The lattice parameters of the tetragonal sigma phase are а=8.809nm and c=4.582nm. The lattice parameter of the fcc phase is 3.615nm. The SEM-BSE image of the Fe40Mn28Ni8Cr24alloy (Fig. 2d) confirms that the alloy has two-phase structure: inside matrix phase slightly elongated second phase particles appear. The volume fraction of the particles can be roughly estimated as of 45%. Local chemical analysis (Table 1) demonstrates that the matrix (point 1,Fig. 2d) is enriched with chromium (32.0%), whereas the particles (point 2,Fig. 2d) contain only 17.8% of Cr.","['f0010', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']",['t0005']
3,Results,"Microhardness measurements (Table 2) demonstrate that the Fe40Mn28Ni8Cr24alloy is ≈3.5 times harder than other alloys after homogenization annealing — its microhardness is 410HV, whereas the microhardness of the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18) alloys is 111–126HV. The microhardness of latter alloys also shows some dependence on Cr concentration — it increases from 111HV of the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4alloy to 126HV of the Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloy.",[],['t0010']
3,Results,"The stress–strain curves obtained during tensile testing of the cold-rolled and annealed Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18) alloys are shown inFig. 3. The resulting mechanical properties, namely, yield strength (σ0.2), ultimate tensile strength (σUTS) elongation to fracture (δf) and uniform elongations (δu) are summarized inTable 3. The mechanical behavior of the tested alloys is similar: they demonstrate relatively low yield strength, but after yielding exhibit prolonged strain hardening stage which promotes high ductility. Chemical composition of the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18) alloys has pronounced effect on their mechanical characteristics. For example, yield strength increases when Cr content increases: from 210MPa of the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4alloy to 310MPa of the Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloy. In contrast, ductility is lower in alloys with higher Cr concentration. For example, the elongation to fracture and uniform elongation of the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4alloy are 71% and 52% respectively, whereas corresponding values for the Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloy are 54% and 37%. The ultimate tensile strength of the alloys shows non-monotonic dependence on Cr content: the strength of the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4alloy is 565MPa, while the strength of the Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12alloy is slightly lower — 545MPa. But σUTSof the Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloy is substantially higher — 605MPa.",['f0020'],['t0015']
4,Discussion,"In this study, structure and mechanical properties of the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18, 24) alloys were examined. Among the examined alloys, the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloys are fcc solid solutions (Fig. 1). Their structure and mechanical behavior are rather similar — cold rolling and annealing at 850°C produced recrystallized structure with grain size of ~10μm (Fig. 2a–c) in the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18) alloys. The recrystallized alloys demonstrate relatively low yield strength, but pronounced strain hardening capacity results in good ductility (Fig. 3). This type of mechanical behavior is typical for Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn system fcc solid solution alloys[7–13,17,18].","['f0010', 'f0015', 'f0020']",[]
4,Discussion,"The mechanical properties of the solid solution Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18) alloys are clearly dependent on Cr and Ni content: increase of Cr content and decrease of Ni content results in pronounced strengthening and decrease of ductility (Fig. 3,Table 3). Although higher strength of Cr-containing equitomic Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn system alloys than their Cr-free counterparts has already been demonstrated[17], strengthening of complexly concentrated multicomponent alloys or HEAs by varying concentration of constitutive elements has never been reported. The examined alloys have single-phase structure and have not contained any precipitates. They also were examined in well-recrystallized condition. Therefore two mechanisms can be responsible for higher strength of higher Cr containing alloys: (i) grain boundary (Hall–Petch) strengthening and (ii) SSS. It is known that strong Hall–Petch dependence is often observed in the fcc Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn-system alloys[7,19,20]. The recrystallized grain size in the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18) alloys continuously decreases from 12.9μm of the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4alloy to 8.1μm of the Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloy. Lower grain size could be attributed to presumably higher melting temperature of the alloys containing more Cr (melting temperature of 1907°C) instead of Ni (melting temperature of 1455°C). Thus the recrystallization annealing temperature (850°C) should correspond to lower homologous temperature for the alloys with higher Cr content. But the grain sizes of the Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloys are only ≈10% different (8.9μm and 8.1μm respectively), while the yield strength of the alloys demonstrates ≈25% difference (245MPa and 310MPa respectively). Thus higher strength observed in the Cr-rich solid solution Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys cannot be attributed to Hall–Petch effect and SSS has to be considered.",['f0020'],['t0015']
4,Discussion,"According to classical Labush approach[21]for concentrated solid solutions, already successfully applied to HEAs[14], the SSS caused by the atoms ofielement can be described as:(1)ΔσSSi=ZGfi4/3Ci2/3whereGis the shear modulus of the alloy,Zis a fitting constant,Ciis the concentration of theielement, andfiis the mismatch parameter. The mismatch parameter,fi, can be calculated using following formula:(2)fi=δGi2+α2δri21/2whereδGi=(1/G)dG/dCiandδri=(1/r)dr/dCiare the atomic modulus and atomic size mismatch parameters, respectively, andαis a constant dependent on the type of the mobile dislocations. Generally,αis 2–4 for the screw dislocations andα≥16 for edge dislocations[22].",[],[]
4,Discussion,"The mismatch parametersδGiandδrican be estimated in accord to method proposed in[22,23]. In fcc lattice every element has 12 nearest-neighbor atoms, thus forming a 13-atom cluster. If the local environment around the alloying elementiis assumed to be equal to the average composition of the alloy, theielement hasNj=13cjofj-atom andNi=13ci−1 ofi-atom neighbors (j≠i). Then the atomic size,δri, and atomic modulus,δGi, mismatches in the vicinity of the elementiare estimated as an average of the atomic size difference,δrij=2(ri−rj)/(ri+rj), and shear modulus difference,δGij=2(Gi−Gj)/(Gi+Gj), respectively, of this element with its neighbors:(3)δri=1312∑cjδrij(4)δGi=1312∑cjδGij.",[],[]
4,Discussion,"The calculated values ofδriandδGifor different constituent elements of the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18) alloys calculated using Eqs.(3) and (4)are given inTable 4. Apparently, increase of the concentration of theielement will result in decrease of the mismatch parameters for theielement as more neighbors of theiatoms will be of the same sort. In contrast, when the concentration of theielement decreases, the mismatch parameters for theielement will increase as more of theiatom neighbors will be of different sorts. Partial replacement of Ni with Cr in the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys demonstrates such tendencies. The highest (absolute) atomic size mismatches,δri, in the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4alloy are around Cr and Ni atoms −0.0188 and −0.0156, respectively. Increase of Cr content and decrease of Ni content result in decrease ofδrCrand increase ofδrNito 0.0140 and −0.0204, respectively, in the Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloy. Similarly, the highest atomic modulus mismatches in the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4alloy are around Cr and Ni atoms −0.3743 and −0.0699, respectively. It should be noted that the absolute value ofδGCris more than 5 times higher than value ofδGNi. In alloys with higher Cr content this difference decreases. For example, in the Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloyδGCrequals to 0.3124 andδGNito −0.1319.","['fo0015', 'fo0020']",['t0020']
4,Discussion,"The dependence of mismatch parameter,fi, for constitutive elements of the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys on the Cr content (in range of 0–24%) is shown inFig. 4a. Thefivalues were calculated using Eq.(2), and theαvalue of 2. Calculations were performed with assumption that all the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys are single solid solution phase with composition corresponding to nominal composition of the alloy. Obviously, the mismatch parameter for Cr is significantly higher than the mismatch parameters for other constitutive elements. However, increase of Cr content results in decrease of mismatch parameter for Cr and increase of mismatch parameter for other elements. For example, thefCrdecreases from 0.394 to 0.287 when Cr content increases from 0% to 24%, whereas thefNiincreases from 0.059 to 0.165. The mismatch parameters for Fe and Mn are lower than that for Ni, and reach maximum values of 0.078 and 0.090 at Cr content of 24%.","['f0025', 'fo0010']",[]
4,Discussion,"The dependence of ∆σSSion Cr content in the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys is shown inFig. 4b. The ∆σSSiwere calculated using Eq.(1), Z value of 0.04 and G value of 80GPa for the CoCrFeNiMn alloy[17]. Obviously, the ∆σSSCrshows strong dependence on Cr content, increasing from 101MPa to 217MPa when Cr content increases from 4% to 18%. The ∆σSSCris significantly higher than solid solution strengthening by other elements: the ∆σSSNiis 44.4–61.4MPa at Cr concentrations of 4–18%, while the ∆σSSFeand ∆σSSMnare respectively 5.2–32.3MPa and 7.8–35.2MPa. It should be noted that, for example, at Cr concentration of 18%, the ∆σSSNiis only ≈28% of ∆σSSCr, whereas the ∆σSSFeand ∆σSSMnare respectively ≈15% and ≈16%. This analysis suggests that SSS by single element (Cr) with atomic fraction of 18% is about 1.5 times higher than strengthening by other elements. Thus the conclusion can be drawn that in complexly concentrated multicomponent alloys only certain elements can produce strong SSS effect, while other constitutive elements only moderately strengthen solid solution.","['f0025', 'fo0005']",[]
4,Discussion,"The SSS effect in multicomponent alloys can be calculated using Gypen and Deruyttere approach[24], already applied to HEAs[14]. According to this approach, solid solution hardening of the alloy, ∆σSS, is calculated using the equation below by summarizing ∆σSSiofeverycomponent of the alloy:(5)ΔσSS=∑iΔσSSi3/22/3.",[],[]
4,Discussion,"The calculated values of the solid solution hardening, ∆σSS,of the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloys is plotted against the experimental yield strength values of the corresponding alloys inFig. 5. In addition, data on several quaternary alloys of the Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn system reported in literature[17,18]with somewhat similar grain sizes of 15μm[18]and 24–48μm[17]. Good fit between the calculated values of ∆σSSand experimentally determined yield strength of the alloys is found. The correlation between predicted SSS and experimental yield strength illustrates two following facts: (i) the methodology developed for predicting SSS in conventional alloys, i.e., Labush approach and Gypen and Deruyttere approach, is adequate for multicomponent alloys or HEAs if contributions from each constitutive element of the alloys are estimated and summarized; (ii) the differences in the yield strength of the solid solution Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18) alloys can be attributed to SSS.",['f0030'],[]
4,Discussion,"If the SSS is the main factor, governing mechanical properties of the solid solution Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys as it is suggested fromFig. 5, there is no surprise that the alloys with higher Cr concentration demonstrate higher strength. Cr apparently produces much stronger hardening than other constitutive elements of the alloys (Fig. 4b) and increase of Cr concentration results in pronounced increase of yield strength. The experimentally observed decrease of ductility of the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrx(x=4, 12, 18) alloys (Table 3) due to higher SSS is also anticipated[25]. However, the σUTSof the solid solution Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys shows non-monotonic dependence on Cr concentration, while the increased SSS is expected to result in increase of σUTS. Probably, the resulting values of the σUTSoriginate from two opposite tendencies: increase of yield strength due to increase of Cr concentration and decrease of work hardening capacity, mirrored in lower values of uniform elongation. The strain hardening capacity could be measured as the difference between σUTSand σ0.2values[18]. The σUTS–σ0.2values are 355MPa, 300MPa and 295MPa for the Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloys, respectively, i.e., they decrease with increase of Cr concentration. However thorough examination of strain hardening behavior of the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys is subject of further investigations.","['f0030', 'f0025']",['t0015']
4,Discussion,"The strong SSS caused by Cr in the Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys suggests that Cr concentration has to be maximized to enhance strength of the alloys. But the Fe40Mn28Ni8Cr24alloy has dual-phase structure, composed of intermetallic sigma phase and fcc solid solution (Fig. 1). Moreover, the results of chemical analysis (Table 1) suggest that Cr-rich matrix is sigma phase, and fcc phase particles are distributed in sigma phase. HEAs with matrix sigma phase have already been reported[23]. Sigma phase is known to be hard but extremely brittle[26]. Thus the drastic increase of hardness (Table 2) and loss of ductility (mirrored in fracture at initial stages of cold rolling) of the Fe40Mn28Ni8Cr24alloy in comparison with the solid solution Fe40Mn28Ni28Cr4, Fe40Mn28Ni20Cr12and Fe40Mn28Ni14Cr18alloys is anticipated. Sigma phase formation in the high Cr containing Fe40Mn28Ni32−xCrxalloys is likely to be caused by high atomic size and modulus mismatches generated by Cr atoms in the fcc lattice (Table 4). High mismatches can result not only in SSS, but also in destabilization of solid solution, like it was already demonstrated in the CoCrFeNiMnxVyalloys[23,27].",['f0010'],"['t0005', 't0010', 't0020']"
4,Discussion,"Formation of sigma phase and related embrittlement of the Fe40Mn28Ni8Cr24alloy demonstrates that there is a limit of Cr solubility in the fcc solid solution of the Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn alloys. This result is in a good agreement with the previously obtained data. For example, while the equiatomic CoCrFeNiMn alloy is solid solution[7], sigma phase was observed in the Ni14Fe20Cr26Co20Mn20alloy[9]. Similarly, the FeNiMnCr18alloy is fcc solid solution[18], while the equiatomic FeNiMnCr alloy has multi-phase structure[28]and presumably contains sigma phase. Using data of current investigation and other sources[7,18,27,28], it can be suggested that 18–20% of Cr can be dissolved in the fcc lattice of the Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn system multicomponent alloys or HEAs, and when Cr concentration increases to 24–26% formation of sigma phase can be expected. But the equiatomic NiCoCrMn and FeNiCoCr alloys are fcc solid solution[28]despite the fact that Cr concentration in these alloys is 25%. From stainless steels experience it is known that other alloying elements including Co, Ni and Mn have complex effect on sigma phase formation[29]. Therefore additional experimental studies are required to establish mutual effect of the constitutive elements of the Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn HEAs on sigma phase formation.",[],[]
4,Discussion,"In summary, the presented results clearly demonstrate that mechanical properties of the promising Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn system HEAs can be tailored by varying concentration of constitutive elements to maximize SSS effect. Together with TWIP effect observed at room temperature in particular compositions of the Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn-based alloys[13,30], and possibility of easy microstructure control by cold or hot working and annealing treatment[9,28,31–35], this makes possible development of the single solid solution phase multicomponent alloys based on Co–Cr–Fe–Ni–Mn system with desired combination of mechanical properties by optimizing their chemical composition and microstructure. Specific attention has to be paid to potential intermetallic phase formation, which may have negative effect on properties of the alloys limiting their ductility. However, intermetallic or ordered phases can be introduced on purpose promoting additional strengthening[5,36–38].",[],[]
