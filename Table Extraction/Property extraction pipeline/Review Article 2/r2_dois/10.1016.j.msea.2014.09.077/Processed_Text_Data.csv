0,Abstract,"The influence of Ti addition and sintering method on the microstructure and mechanical behavior of a medium-entropy alloy, Al0.6CoNiFe alloy, was studied in detail. Alloying behavior, microstructure, phase evolution and mechanical properties of Al0.6CoNiFe and Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloys were investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), as well as by mechanical testing. During the mechanical alloying (MA) process, a supersaturated solid solution consisting of both BCC and FCC phases was formed in the Al0.6CoNiFe alloy. With Ti addition, the Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloy exhibited a supersaturated solid solution with a single FCC phase. Following hot pressing (HP), the HP sintered (HP’ed) Al0.6CoNiFe bulk alloy was composed of a major BCC phase and a minor FCC phase. The HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloy exhibited a FCC phase, two BCC phases and a trace unidentified phase. Nanoscale twins were present in the HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloy, where deformation twins were observed in the FCC phase. Our results suggest that the addition of Ti facilitated the formation of nanoscale twins. The compressive strength and Vickers hardness of HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloy were slightly lower than the corresponding values of the HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy. In contrast with HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy, spark plasma sintered (SPS’ed) Al0.6CoNiFe alloy exhibited a major FCC phase and a minor BCC phase. Moreover, the SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy exhibited a lower compressive strength and Vickers hardness, but singificantly higher plasticity, as compared to those of the HP’ed counterpart material.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In the past decade, solid solution alloys containing five or more principal elements in equi-atomic or nearly equi-atomic proportions have received considerable interest from the scientific community, which have been referred to as high entropy alloys (HEAs) since Yeh et al. defined this new class of alloys[1]. For a completely random mixing in multi-component alloy systems, the entropy of mixing (ΔSmix) is calculated by the following equation[2]:(1)ΔSmix=−R∑i=1n(cilnci)whereciis the atomic fraction of theith element,Ris the gas constant, 8.314JK−1mol−1, andnis the number of component elements. Evidently,ΔSmixreaches its maximum when an equal atomic fraction of each element is used in ann-element alloy system. Whenn≥5,ΔSmix≥1.61Rfor equiatomic HEA systems[1,3]. Traditional alloys based on one or two major metallic element(s) haveΔSmixwhich do not exceed 0.69R, thus these alloys can be classified as low-entropy alloys[4]. Multi-component alloys consisting of three or four elements in equi- or nearly equi-atomic proportions are often defined as medium-entropy alloys[3].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"By definition, HEAs have at least five principal elements whose individual atomic concentrations are between 5% and 35at%[1]. One would assume that intermetallics and other complex compounds can be easily formed in such alloys. Surprisingly, HEAs reported in the literature exhibit only simple solid solutions with FCC and/or BCC structures[1,5–10], and this anomalous phenomenon is attributed to the high-entropy effect. In HEA systems, the high positive entropy of mixing results in a low total free energy, and mixing, i.e., the formation of a solid solution, is favored over phase separation or compound formation, even if the enthalpy of the latter is low. As a result, intermetallics are absent and solid solutions with simple FCC and/or BCC structures are formed in multi-component HEAs. In addition to the above-mentioned unique structural and compositional characteristics, HEAs possess promising mechanical, magnetic and electrochemical properties, such as high hardness, high strength, high thermal stability, excellent wear resistance and outstanding oxidation resistance[11–17], etc.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In the literature, various experimental techniques have been utilized to prepare HEAs, e.g., arc-melting[11,18], copper mold casting[14], mold-clamp casting[19], fluxed water quenching[20], melt spinning[21], injection casting[22], induction melting[23], mechanical alloying (MA)[24], reactive DC sputtering[25]and laser cladding[26], etc. However, review of the literature shows that casting is the most widely used method for processing HEAs, especially copper mold casting and arc-melting. To overcome the potential segregation and inhomogeneous microstructure generated by casting, MA has been developed to prepare HEAs with better homogeneity of microstructure at room temperature[24,27–30]. In addition, the process of MA tends to form nanocrystalline grains in the alloyed powders. Consolidation techniques, such as hot pressing (HP)[27,29], hot isostatic pressing (HIP)[29]and spark plasma sintering (SPS)[30,31], etc., are usually applied to obtain bulk HEAs from mechanically alloyed HEA powders. It is possible to obtain ultra-fine or even nanocrystalline grain sizes in the bulk HEAs after sintering the alloyed powders, if proper sintering parameters are utilized, e.g., low temperature and high cooling rate.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Inspection of the literature reveals that most of the reported HEAs which are prepared by MA followed by densification have equi-atomic concentrations[24,27–30], and that there have been very few reports on medium-entropy alloys prepared by MA[30,32]. Fe, Ni, and Co with similar atomic radii can form solid solution easily, and moderate concentrations of Al and Ti with larger atomic radii are usually added into some HEAs with the aim of achieving excellent mechanical properties[14,30,31].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Thus, in view of the above discussion, the objective of the present study is to provide insight into the influence of chemistry and sintering methodology on phase composition and mechanical behavior of a medium-entropy alloy. To accomplish this objective, a non-equiatomic Al0.6CoNiFe medium-entropy alloy was designed, with a composition that has heretofore not been reported in the literature. In addition, the effect of titanium addition on the alloying behavior, microstructure and mechanical properties of the alloy was systematically investigated. To that effect, an Al0.6CoNiFe medium-entropy alloy and a Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe HEA were first processed by MA, and subsequently, the mechanically alloyed powders of Al0.6CoNiFe were sintered by hot pressing (HP) and spark plasma sintering (SPS), respectively, while the mechanically alloyed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe powders were only consolidated by HP. By performing HP and SPS, respectively, on the Al0.6CoNiFe powders, the influence of sintering methodology on the microstructure and mechanical properties of Al0.6CoNiFe alloy was investigated. The selection of SPS as sintering approach was motivated by recent results which suggest that field assisted sintering (FAS) techniques, such as SPS, can effectively retain the initial microstructure in the MA powders after sintering[30,31].",[],[]
2,Experimental details,"The nominal compositions of the investigated alloys are Al0.6CoNiFe and Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe (expressed in molar ratio). Elemental powders of Al, Ti, Co, Ni and Fe with high purity (>99.7wt%) and particle size of ≤45µm (325 mesh) were used as starting materials. The powders were placed with tungsten carbide balls with a ball-to-powder weight ratio of 10:1 in a stainless steel vial, and the vial was filled with Ar and then sealed. The sealed vial was fitted in a high energy planetary ball milling machine operated at 300rpm. After milling in Ar for 38h, ethanol was injected into the vial and the powders were subsequently milled in ethanol for 4h. When the milling was completed, the vial was placed in a vacuum oven and the milled powders were allowed to dry via evaporation of ethanol. Following drying, the milled powders were allowed to pass through a 75µm sieve. Finally, the powders were consolidated by HP and SPS, respectively. The HP of Al0.6CoNiFe and Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloyed powders was performed in a vacuum hot press (HP-12×12×12, Centorr Vacuum Industries, USA), with a vacuum pressure <1.3×10−2Pa. The heating rate was 5°C/min until 200°C, and it was changed to 20°C/min thereafter. The sintering temperature was 1000°C with a holding time of 1h. A constant uniaxial pressure of 30MPa was applied during sintering. After sintering, the samples were naturally cooled down to room temperature. The SPS of the Al0.6CoNiFe powders was carried out using a Dr. Sinter 825 apparatus (Sumitomo Coal Mining Co. Ltd., Japan) in a graphite die with 20.4mm inner diameter at 1000°C for 8min with a constant pressure of 30MPa applied. For easy removal of the sample after sintering and to minimize thermal gradients during SPS, graphite foils of 0.2mm thickness were placed between the punches and the powders, and between the die and the powders. The heating rate used in our experiments was 80°C/min from room temperature to 100°C, 90°C/min from 100°C to 900°C, and 50°C/min from 900°C to 1000°C. The vacuum pressure was maintained at <8Pa. After HP and SPS, the samples with a diameter of 20mm and height of approximately 8mm were grounded to remove the surface layer of 0.5mm thickness in order to eliminate the reaction layer with graphite. The density was measured by the Archimedes׳ method. The specimens for mechanical testing were prepared by electrical discharge machining.",[],[]
2,Experimental details,"The milled powders and sintered bulk samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation. The microstructures were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). SEM was carried out using a Zeiss Supra 40 (Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH, Germany), and the samples were prepared by polishing and subsequent etching with an aqua regia solution. TEM specimens were prepared by mechanical thinning followed by ion milling at room temperature, and TEM with selected area electron diffraction (SAED) was performed using a JEOL JEM-2100 (Tokyo, Japan) operated at 200kV. Uniaxial compression tests at ambient temperature were performed on samples ofΦ3mm×4.5mm using an Instron 5500 testing system at a strain rate of 1×10−3s−1. Three compression tests were carried out to obtain average mechanical properties for each sample. Vickers hardness measurements were performed on the consolidated samples with a load of 300g using a HVS-1000 digital micro-hardness tester. The reported hardness value of a sample is the average of a minimum of 10 measurements.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition on alloying behavior," Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the mechanically alloyed powders of Al0.6CoNiFe and Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe. Fig. 1(a)  presents the XRD patterns of Al0.6CoNiFe alloy powders for different milling times. The data reveal the diffraction peaks corresponding to all elemental components present prior to milling. As milling time increases, the intensity of constituent elemental peaks decreases, and Al and Co dissolve rapidly within 6h. However, as milling time is increased to 27h, the peaks corresponding to Ni and Fe can still be detected, indicating that a complete solid solution has not been formed. After 38h of milling, peaks appear corresponding to solid solution phases exhibiting FCC and BCC crystal structures, respectively. These two solid solution phases can be indexed as a FCC solid solution with a lattice parameter of 3.74Å and a BCC solid solution with a lattice parameter of 3.07Å[27–30]. Following 38h of milling, there are no other phases detected by XRD. To further reduce the grain and particle sizes, the powders milled in Ar for 38h were subjected to additional milling in ethanol for 4h. Peak broadening is evident after the powders were milled for 42h, indicating a reduction in crystallite size as well as an increase in lattice strain. Fig. 1(b)  shows the XRD pattern of Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe powders with different milling durations, which contain 10at% Ti. When the milling time is less than 38h, the alloying behavior of Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe powders is similar to that of Al0.6CoNiFe powders. As the milling time reaches 38h, the XRD pattern reveals that a solid solution is formed, with FCC crystal structure having a lattice parameter of 3.71Å[27–30]. The FCC phase of Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe powders has lattice parameter similar to that of the FCC phase of Al0.6CoNiFe powders. However, with Ti addition, the former does not have the BCC phase that is present in the latter. It appears that Ti facilitates the formation of a single solid solution with FCC crystal structure. After 4h of wet ball milling (42h of total milling duration), the peaks exhibit evident broadening, which is attributed to increase in lattice strain and reduction in crystallite size.","['f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition on alloying behavior,"The morphology and size of powder particles for milled powders were investigated using SEM. Fig. 2 shows secondary electron micrographs of Al0.6CoNiFe powders milled for different milling times, i.e., 0, 6, 15, 27, 38 and 42h. Fig. 2(a)  shows that before milling, there are large differences in morphology and size among different powder particles. After 6h of milling, powder particles tend to have morphology and size similar to each other, and the particle sizes are increased significantly compared to those before milling ( Fig. 2(b) ). Powder particles in the 15h and 30h milled powders have morphology and sizes similar to those of particles in the 6h milled powders. After 38h of milling, particle sizes tend to decrease, and the particle size distribution becomes wider ( Fig. 2(e) ). After wet ball milling in ethanol for 4h, the powder particles exhibit lamellar morphology, contrasted by the equiaxed morphology before wet milling, and the particle sizes are significantly reduced ( Fig. 2(f) ). EDS was performed on the 42h milled powders. Fig. 2(g)  shows the EDS spectrum corresponding to Area A in Fig. 2(f) , and Fig. 2(h)  displays the composition measured by EDS together with the nominal composition of the powders. It can be seen from Fig. 2(h)  that the observed and nominal compositions are well consistent with each other, suggesting an excellent chemical homogeneity obtained by MA. During the MA process, with addition of Ti into Al0.6CoNiFe powders, the evolution in powder particle size and morphology for Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe powders is very similar to that for Al0.6CoNiFe powders. However, it is noted that after 38h of milling, the particles in Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe powders have significantly smaller sizes and narrower size distribution than those in Al0.6CoNiFe powders, as revealed by Fig. 3(a) . Similarly, after 4h of wet milling, particle morphology in Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe powders changed from equiaxed to lamellar, and particle sizes are significantly reduced compared with those of 38h milled powders ( Fig. 3(b) ). Fig. 3(c)  and (d) display the results of EDS analysis of the 42h milled Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe powders. Fig. 3(c)  shows the EDS spectrum from Area B in Fig. 3(b) , and Fig. 3(d)  presents the corresponding measured composition along with the nominal composition of the powders, suggesting that the observed and nominal compositions are consistent with each other.","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition on alloying behavior,"As mentioned above, after 38h of milling, two solid solutions with FCC and BCC structures, respectively, are present in the Al0.6CoNiFe powders, whereas a single solid solution with FCC structure is formed in the Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe powders. Usually, intermetallic compounds and other complicated compounds can be readily formed in multi-component alloys. In Al0.6CoNiFe and Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloys, the absence of intermetallic compounds and the presence of simple solid solution phases can be attributed to high entropy of mixing and to solubility extension achieved by the non-equilibrium MA process[1,33,34]. After the MA process, Al0.6CoNiFe medium-entropy alloy exhibits both FCC and BCC phases, whereas there is only FCC phase in Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe HEA, indicating that the addition of Ti into Al0.6CoNiFe alloy facilitates elimination of the BCC phase. In Al-containing HEAs, the formation of BCC phase is often dependent on the concentration of Al[14,35]. With increasing Al concentration, the HEAs tend to exhibit an evolution from a single FCC phase to a mixture of FCC and BCC phases, even to a single BCC phase when the Al concentration is sufficiently high. In addition, Fe tends to favor the formation of BCC phase during MA[30,31]. With the addition of Ti into Al0.6CoNiFe alloy, the concentrations of Al and Fe are decreased. Meanwhile, after Ti addition, the entropy of mixing in Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe is higher than that in Al0.6CoNiFe, facilitating the formation of a single-phase solid solution. Therefore, after the MA process, Al0.6CoNiFe alloy possesses a mixture of FCC and BCC phases, whereas only FCC phase is present in Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloy, with the absence of the BCC phase.",[],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition and sintering method on microstructure and phase evolution," Fig. 4 shows the XRD patterns of bulk Al0.6CoNiFe and Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloys after densification. Fig. 4(a)  presents XRD patterns of the bulk Al0.6CoNiFe alloy sintered using different methods. It can be seen that both HP’ed and SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe samples possess one FCC phase and one BCC phase[27,31,35]. Hence, the two phases observed in the milled powders have been retained after sintering. In addition, no oxides can be detected in the sintered bulk samples. It should be noted that the major phase in HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy is the BCC phase, whereas the FCC phase dominates in the SPS’ed counterpart; further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms. The lattice parameters of FCC and BCC phases in HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy are measured as 3.71Å and 3.12Å, respectively, and the lattice parameters of FCC and BCC phases in SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy are 3.73Å and 3.13Å[28–31,35], respectively. Thus, the calculated lattice parameter values for the HP’ed sample are close to those for the SPS’ed counterpart, and these values are also similar to those for the milled powders.","['f0020', 'f0020']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition and sintering method on microstructure and phase evolution," Fig. 4(b)  presents the XRD pattern of HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe, indicating that the bulk alloy is composed of one FCC phase, two BCC phases (denoted as BCC1 and BCC2), and a trace unknown phase. The measured lattice parameters of these three phases are 3.71Å (FCC), 2.89Å (BCC1) and 3.11Å (BCC2)[27,31,35], respectively. Note that the milled Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe powders exhibit only one single FCC phase, indicating that phase transformation occurred during the HP process. Specifically, the FCC phase may be decomposed into two BCC phases, one new FCC phase and one unknown phase. MA is a non-equilibrium process which can yield metastable phases and supersaturated solid solutions[28,30,31], however, the supersaturated solid solutions and metastable phases evolve into stable equilibrium phases during sintering[30,31], and moreover, the excess energy stored in grain boundaries with significant volume fraction can provide energy to facilitate phase transformation.",['f0020'],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition and sintering method on microstructure and phase evolution,"The density of sintered bulk samples was determined according to Archimedes׳ method using high purity ethanol.

It is evident that SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe shows higher density than the HP’ed counterpart, which may be attributed to the fact that mass transport and therefore densification is enhanced during SPS[36,37].",[],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition and sintering method on microstructure and phase evolution," Fig. 5 shows SEM micrographs of the consolidated alloys. From Fig. 5(a) , the etched surface of HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe exhibits two distinctively different types of areas, i.e., dark flat areas (zone 1) and gray areas with corrosion pits (zone 2). In an earlier study, we found that the FCC phases of sintered AlxCoNiFe and AlxCoNiFeTi HEA systems exhibited better resistance to acid corrosion, and that the BCC phases could be easily etched by the aqua regia solution[38]. Thus, the dark flat areas in Fig. 5(a)  correspond to the FCC phase of HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe, while the gray areas are associated with the BCC phase. The SEM image of the etched surface of SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe ( Fig. 5(b) ) also shows two distinctive areas, i.e., dark flat areas (zone 3) corresponding to the FCC phase and gray areas with corrosion pits (zone 4) corresponding to the BCC phase. Comparing Fig. 5(b)  with Fig. 5(a) , it is evident that SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe possesses higher fraction of dark flat areas and correspondingly higher fraction of FCC phase, consistent with the results from XRD ( Fig. 4(a) ). Fig. 5(c)  illustrates that the HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe HEA includes three distinctive areas, i.e., large flat areas (zone 5), small flat areas (zone 6) and concave areas, however, it is not easy to individually associate the different areas with the different phases in this material.","['f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0020', 'f0025']",[]

The SAED pattern of Region A along [011] zone axis confirms a FCC structure, and the SAED pattern corresponding to Region B along [113] zone axis reveals a BCC structure. In addition, the SAED pattern of the FCC phase shows weak superlattice reflections corresponding to L12structure[39]. The lattice parameters of these two phases as measured by the SAED patterns are 3.72Å (FCC) and 3.10Å (BCC), respectively, indicating that these values are close to the results calculated from the XRD patterns[28–31,39].","['f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030']",[]

Bright field image ( Fig. 7(a) ) potentially reveals the presence of four different phases, marked as Regions 1–4. Fig. 7(b)  displays a SAED pattern corresponding to Region 1, exhibiting the characteristics of a SAED pattern of a FCC structure along [011] zone axis. Note that the FCC phase also exhibits weak superlattice reflections in the SAED pattern corresponding to the L12structure[39], similar to the FCC phase in HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy as described above. The SAED pattern in Fig. 7(c)  along [111] zone axis corresponding to Region 2 reveals a BCC structure, denoted as BCC1 phase. The SAED pattern in Fig. 7(d)  confirms that Region 3 possesses a BCC structure, denoted as BCC2 phase; weak superlattice reflections corresponding to B2 structure are also present in the SAED pattern[39]. In addition, the nanoscale phase marked as Region 4 in Fig. 7(a)  may correspond to the unknown phase revealed by the XRD pattern in Fig. 4(b) . The lattice parameters of these phases as measured by the SAED patterns are 3.71Å (FCC), 2.91Å (BCC1) and 3.10Å (BCC2), respectively, which are also close to the values calculated from the XRD patterns[28–31,39]. Note that the FCC phase of Al0.6CoNiFe and the FCC phase of Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe have identical lattice parameters. Interestingly, twins are observed in the FCC phase of Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe HEA, and a similar phenomenon was reported in our previous investigations[31,40]. Fig. 7(e)  shows a SAED pattern of twinned FCC phase corresponding to Region 5. Fig. 8 presents TEM images with higher magnification and corresponding SAED patterns of nanoscale twins present in HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe. Fig. 8(a)  displays a twinned FCC grain with corresponding SAED pattern presented in the inset. The lamella thickness of this nanoscale twin is approximately 32nm. Fig. 8(b)  shows another twinned FCC grain, and the average thickness of the nanoscale twins is approximately 28nm. However, nanoscale twins were not observed in the FCC phase of HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe medium-entropy alloy, suggesting that the addition of Ti into Al0.6CoNiFe can facilitate the formation of nanoscale twins in the FCC phase.","['f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0020', 'f0035', 'f0040', 'f0040', 'f0040']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition and sintering method on microstructure and phase evolution,"The formation of fewer phases and simple solid solution phases in HEAs is usually attributed to high entropy of mixing (ΔSmix)[1]. According to the definition of HEAs, entropy of mixing of HEAs with at least five constituent elements must be no less than 13.39JK−1mol−1(ΔSmix≥1.61R)[1,3]. However, according to Eq.(1), entropy of mixing for Al0.6CoNiFe and Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloys are 11.36JK−1mol−1and 12.92JK−1mol−1, respectively. Thus, sole consideration of entropy of mixing appears to be insufficient to explain phase formation in the two alloy systems investigated. It should be noted that enthalpy of mixing (ΔHmix) and atomic size difference (δ) also play critical roles in the phase formation in multiple-component alloys[30,41,42]. Significantly negativeΔHmixfavors the tendency for ordering or clustering[42]. On the contrary, solid solution phases can be formed whenΔHmixis either slightly positive or insignificantly negative, andδis small (δ≤6.6%)[42,43]. To consider all the significance ofΔHmix,δandΔSmixto the formation of solid solution phase in HEAs, Yang et al.[42]proposed a rule for the formation of stable solid solution in multi-component HEAs, i.e., a thermodynamic parameterΩ≥1.1 and meanwhileδ≤6.6%; largerΩand smallerδare beneficial to the formation of solid solution.Ωandδare defined by the following two equations:(3)Ω=TmΔSmix|ΔHmix|(4)δ=∑i=1nci(1−ri/r¯)2whereciis the atomic percentage of theith component,∑i=1nci=1,r¯=∑i=1nciriis the average atomic radius andriis the atomic radius of theith component.Tm=∑i=1nci(Tm)i, where(Tm)iis the melting point of theith component.ΔHmix=∑i=1,i≠jnΩijcicj, whereΩij(=4ΔHijmix)is the regular solution interaction parameter between theith andjth components,ΔHijmixis the enthalpy of mixing theith andjth components, obtained on the basis of Miedema macroscopic model for binary liquid alloys[44].",[],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition and sintering method on microstructure and phase evolution," Table 1 lists the values of enthalpy of mixing of different atom pairs and the atomic size for the constituent elements of the investigated Al0.6CoNiFe and Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloys[44]. The calculated values of parameters (δ, ΔHmix, ΔSmix,Tm,Ω) for these two alloys are shown in Table 2 . It can be seen thatΩ≥1.1 andδ≤6.6% for both Al0.6CoNiFe and Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloys, and according to the rule of the formation of solid solution phase proposed by Yang et al., solid solution phases instead of intermatellics are formed in these two alloys, which is consistent with the experimental results. Note that the HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloy exhibits four phases, whereas HP’ed and SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloys both display only two solution phases. This fact can be explained by the relative magnitude ofΔSmix,ΔHmix,Ωandδ. AlthoughΔSmixof the Al0.6CoNiFe alloy is lower than that of the Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloy,ΔHmixof the former (−10.56kJmol−1) is insignificantly negative whereas that of the latter (−18.35kJmol−1) is noticeably negative. In addition,Ωof the former is 1.75 which is significantly higher than the critical value of 1.1 whereas that of the latter is 1.17 which is nearly equal to the critical value. Moreover,δof the former (4.95) is smaller than that of the latter (6.08).

3.3,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition and sintering method on mechanical behavior,"High strength and high hardness of HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe may be attributed to significant solid solution strengthening by Al atoms with significantly larger atomic radius than the other constituent elements, as well as to grain-boundary strengthening due to ultrafine grain sizes[45,46]. High strength and high hardness of HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe may be attributed to solid solution strengthening by Al and Ti atoms, and to grain-boundary strengthening[45,46]. With the addition of Ti, compressive strength and Vickers hardness of HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloy decrease slightly compared to those of HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe. As analyzed inSection 3.2, HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe exhibits a major BCC phase and a minor FCC phase; after introducing Ti into Al0.6CoNiFe alloy, the Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloy possesses two BCC phases (BCC1 and BCC2 phases) and one FCC phase, as well as one nanoscale unknown phase. The volume fraction of the BCC phases in HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe is less than that of the BCC phase in HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy, as suggested by the XRD patterns in Fig. 4 . In general, BCC phase tends to have higher strength and hardness than FCC phase in HEAs, whereas FCC phase tends to possess higher plasticity[30,31]. Hence, the lower volume fraction of BCC phases in HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloy results in lower compressive strength and Vicker hardness compared with those of HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy.",['f0020'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Influence of Ti addition and sintering method on mechanical behavior,"Yield strength, compressive strength, strain-to-failure and Vickers hardness of SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy are 2200MPa, 2386MPa, 6.2% and 667HV, respectively. Compared with HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy, compressive strength and Vickers hardness of SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy are decreased by 18.1% and 22.9%, respectively. In contrast with the HP’ed alloy, SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy shows significantly improved plasticity. Note that SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy possesses a major FCC phase and a minor BCC phase, whereas the main phase in HP’ed counterpart is the BCC phase. Thus, the improved plasticity and the decreased strength and hardness of SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy are attributed to the increased volume fraction of the FCC phase and the decreased volume fraction of the BCC phase.",[],[]
4,Conclusion,"Bulk Al0.6CoNiFe medium-entropy and Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe high-entropy multi-component alloys were successfully synthesized by MA followed by consolidation via HP or SPS. After the MA process, both FCC and BCC phases were observed in Al0.6CoNiFe medium-entropy alloy, whereas a single FCC phase was obtained in Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe HEA system. During MA, the addition of Ti facilitates the elimination of the BCC phase and the formation of a single solid solution with FCC structure. After SPS, Al0.6CoNiFe alloy consists of a major FCC and a minor BCC phase. After HP, in Al0.6CoNiFe alloy, a major BCC phase and a minor FCC phase were observed, whereas two BCC phases, one FCC phase and an unknown phase are present in Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe HEA. The lattice parameter of the FCC phase of HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe HEA is identical to that of the FCC phase of HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe alloy. In addition, nanoscale twins were only observed in HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe HEA, suggesting that the addition of Ti facilitates the formation of twins. Both HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe and HP’ed Ti0.4Al0.6CoNiFe alloys exhibit high strength and hardness, however, the addition of Ti decreases compressive strength and Vickers hardness slightly. In addition, SPS’ed Al0.6CoNiFe possesses lower compressive strength, lower Vickers hardness and higher plasticity than HP’ed Al0.6CoNiFe.",[],[]
