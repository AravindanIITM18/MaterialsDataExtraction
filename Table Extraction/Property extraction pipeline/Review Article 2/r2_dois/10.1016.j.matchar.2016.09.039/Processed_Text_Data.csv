0,Abstract,"In present study, structure and mechanical properties of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) high-entropy alloys after arc melting and annealing at 1200°C for 24h are investigated. The CrNbTiVZr alloy is composed of body centered cubic (bcc) and C15 (face centered cubic) Laves phases while the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys consist of bcc and two C14 (hexagonal close packed) Laves phases with different chemical compositions. Thermodynamic modeling predicts existence of two phases – bcc and C15 Laves phase and broadening of single bcc phase field due to Al addition. The density of the alloys decreases with the increase of Al content. The alloys are found to be extremely brittle at room temperature and 600°C. The alloys have high strength at temperatures of 800–1000°C. For example, yield strength at 800°C increases from 440MPa for the CrNbTiVZr alloy to 1250MPa for the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy. The experimental phase composition of the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys is compared with predicted equilibrium phases and the factors governing the transformation of C15 to C14 Laves phases due to Al addition to the CrNbTiVZr alloy analyzed. Specific properties of the alloys are compared with other high-entropy alloys and commercial Ni-based superalloys.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"There is a rising interest among researchers to the so-called high-entropy alloys (HEAs). HEAs are a new promising class of metallic alloys, commonly of at least 4–5 elements taken in nearly equimolar concentrations[1]. HEAs have been considered as potential structural materials for high-temperature usage[2]due to their attractive features, including sluggish diffusion effect[3]which is expected to stabilize the structure of the alloys at elevated temperatures. For the purpose of full realization of the potential of HEAs in the capacity of the high-temperature materials, the so-called refractory HEAs were introduced[4–6]. A number of HEAs based on refractory elements have shown superior high-temperature strength, exceeding currently used nickel-based superalloys[4–17], thus demonstrating the attractiveness of this class of the alloys. However, one of the important limitations of the first-developed refractory HEAs was their high density[4–8]. There have been many efforts to produce lighter alloys by usage of alloying elements with lower atomic weight[18–32].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"One of the particularly attractive elements in this regard is Al[20–32]. Besides an apparent decrease of the density[20–23,25,26,28,30–32], a number of studies reported a beneficial effect of Al on mechanical properties of HEAs based on refractory elements, in particular, an increase in room-temperature[20,21,23,25]and high-temperature strength[21,32]. But there is diverse information on the effect of Al on phase composition of refractory HEAs in the literature. In some cases, it was demonstrated that the alloys with initially single body centered cubic (bcc) structure like the NbTiVTa, NbTiMoV, and HfNbTaTiZr alloys retained their structure when Al was added[20,23,25]. Moreover, the ability of Al to stabilize solid solution phases instead of ordered or intermetallic ones was observed when it was added to the CrMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy[21]. In contrast, it was reported that Al facilitates the formation of intermetallic phases, including Laves phase, when it is added to initially bcc structured NbTiVZr alloy[31,32]. Apparently, the difference in interaction between Al and other constitutive elements of the alloys is responsible for the diverse effect of Al on phase composition of the alloys. Due to the attractiveness of usage of Al in the development of HEAs based on refractory elements with high specific strength, it's worth to explore its effect further.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Therefore in the present study we have studied the effect of Al addition on the structure and mechanical properties of the CrNbTiVZr alloy. The CrNbTiVZr alloy is composed of a major C15 (fcc) Laves and a minor bcc phases according to[18]and has remarkable high-temperature mechanical properties[19]. The goals of current study are (i) to analyze the effect of Al content on phase composition of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys; and (ii) to evaluate the impact of Al content on mechanical properties, including specific ones, of the CrNbTiVZr alloy at elevated temperatures.",[],[]
2,Experimental Procedures,"The alloys with a nominal composition of CrNbTiVZr (marked further as Al0), Al0.25CrNbTiVZr (marked further as Al0.25), Al0.5CrNbTiVZr (marked further as Al0.5) and AlCrNbTiVZr (marked further as Al1) were produced by arc melting of the elements in a low-pressure, high-purity argon atmosphere inside a water-cooled copper cavity. The purities of the alloying elements were no <99.9at.%. The produced ingots of the alloys had dimensions of about 6×12×40mm3. As-solidified ingots were annealed at 1200°C for 24h. Prior to annealing, the samples were sealed in vacuumed (10−2Torr) quartz tubes filled with titanium chips to prevent oxidation.",[],[]
2,Experimental Procedures,Microstructure and phase composition of the alloys after annealing at 1200°C were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The XRD analysis was performed using RIGAKU diffractometer and Cu Kα radiation. Samples for SEM observations were prepared by mechanical polishing. SEM investigations were performed utilizing FEI Quanta 600 FEG or Nova NanoSEM microscopes equipped with energy-dispersive (EDS) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) detectors.

Vickers microhardness, HV, was measured on polished cross-section surfaces of the annealed specimens using a 136-degree Vickers diamond pyramid under a 300g load applied for 15s. Compressive tests at 22°C, 600°C, 800°C and 1000°C were performed on rectangular specimens with dimensions of 6×4×4mm3using the Instron 300LX machine equipped with the radial heating furnace. Specimens were placed in the preheated to testing temperature furnace and held for ≈10min to equilibrate the temperature prior to testing. The temperature of the specimen was controlled by a thermocouple attached to the side surface of the specimen. The initial strain rate was 10−4s−1.",[],[]

Table 1 summarizes data on the crystal lattice parameters of different phases. The CrNbTiVZr alloy is composed of bcc phase and C15 (face centered cubic, fcc) Laves phase of ZrVCr-type[33]with the corresponding lattice parameters of abcc=0.3294±0.0007nm and afcc=0.7270±0.0002nm. The structure of the Al-containing alloys is presented by bcc phase and two different C14 (hexagonal close packed, hcp) Laves phases - C14 Laves phase of ZrCrAl-type[34]and C14 Laves phase of ZrAl2-type[35]. Notably, the intensity of the Bragg peaks owned to the C14 ZrCrAl-type phase is significantly higher than that of C14 ZrAl2-type phase. The lattice parameter of bcc phase gradually decreases with an increase in Al content from abcc=0.3235±0.0002nm for the Al0·25CrNbTiVZr alloy to abcc=0.3202±0.0002nm for the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy. The lattice parameter of the C14 ZrCrAl-type phase is not sensitive to Al content whereas the lattice parameter of the C14 ZrAl2-type phase slightly decreases with an increment of Al concentration ( Table 1 ).",['f0005'],"['t0005', 't0005']"
3.1,Results.Structure of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) Alloys," Fig. 2 demonstrates SEM-BSE images and EBSD phase maps of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys after annealing at 1200°C. Chemical compositions of the corresponding structural constituents are given in Table 2 . The CrNbTiVZr alloy is composed of two constituents: bright phase (marked as #1 in Fig. 2 a, b), enriched with Nb and Ti ( Table 2 ), and dark-grey phase (marked as #2), enriched with Cr, V and Zr ( Table 2 ). EBSD analysis ( Fig. 2 b) reveals the bright phase has bcc structure and the dark-grey phase is C15 (fcc) Laves phase, which is in an agreement with XRD analysis ( Fig. 1 , Table 1 ) and previously reported data[18]. Both phases are close to equiaxed, homogenously distributed relatively fine particles thus forming microduplex microstructure. Many twins can be found in Laves phase particles. The volume fractions of the C15 Laves phase measured from SEM images and EBSD are 53±3% and 58±2%, respectively ( Table 2 ).","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0005']","['t0010', 't0010', 't0010', 't0005', 't0010']"
3.1,Results.Structure of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) Alloys," Fig. 2 c, d illustrates the microstructure of the Al0.25CrNbTiVZr alloy. The morphology of the microstructure resembles much that of the CrNbTiVZr alloy ( Fig. 2 a, b). However, EBSD analysis ( Fig. 2 d) has revealed that the Al0.25CrNbTiVZr alloy is composed of bcc (marked as #1 in Fig. 2 c, d) and C14 (hcp) Laves phases. Moreover, SEM-EDS analysis has exposed that two variants of the C14 (hcp) Laves phases with different chemical compositions are found in the alloy, which is consistent with the XRD analysis ( Fig. 1 , Table 1 ). Note that the SEM-BSE image ( Fig. 2 c) has also revealed different contrast from the Laves phase particles. Possibly, EBSD analysis does not differentiate between the two C14 Laves phases due to their very close crystal structure ( Table 1 ) and limited sensitivity of the method[36]. One of the C14 Laves phases is enriched with Al, Cr, and Zr and identified as C14 ZrCrAl-type phase (marked as #2). Another C14 Laves phase is mainly composed of Al and Zr and can be defined as C14 ZrAl2-type phase (marked as #3). The volume fractions of the C14 ZrCrAl-type and C14 ZrAl2-type phases measured from SEM are 51±4% and 13±1%, respectively, which is comparable with the volume fraction (67±2%) of C14 Laves phase(s) measured by EBSD ( Table 2 ). Note that the Laves phases in the current alloy do not contain twins.","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0005', 'f0010']","['t0005', 't0005', 't0010']"
3.1,Results.Structure of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) Alloys,"The structures of the Al0.5CrNbTiVZr ( Fig. 2 e, f) and AlCrNbTiVZr ( Fig. 2 g, h) alloys are almost identical to each other and are not different from the microstructure of the Al0.25CrNbTiVZr alloy ( Fig. 2 c, d). However, some changes in the chemical compositions of the structural constituents must be noted ( Table 2 ). SEM-EDS analysis of the C14 ZrCrAl-type phase in the Al0.25CrNbTiVZr, Al0.5CrNbTiVZr and AlCrNbTiVZr alloys has shown a continuous depletion of Cr and V together with gradually increased Al content and almost unchanged concentrations of Ti, Nb, Zr ( Table 2 ). In turn, the chemical composition of the C14 ZrAl2-type phase changes only between the Al0.25CrNbTiVZr and Al0.5CrNbTiVZr alloys: Zr concentration pronouncedly decreases together with an increase of Al and Ti concentrations ( Table 2 ). Differences in the chemical compositions of the C14 ZrAl2-type phase of the Al0.5CrNbTiVZr and AlCrNbTiVZr alloys are insignificant ( Table 2 ). The volume fractions of the C14 ZrCrAl-type and C14 ZrAl2-type phases measured from SEM images are identical for both Al0.5CrNbTiVZr and AlCrNbTiVZr alloys and estimated to be 52–53±3% and 13±1%, respectively. Moreover, the C14 Laves phase volume fraction measured by EBSD is the same for both alloys and equal to 67±2% ( Table 2 ).","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010']","['t0010', 't0010', 't0010', 't0010', 't0010']"
3.2,Results.Thermodynamic Modeling of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) Alloys,"The simulated equilibrium phase diagrams of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys are presented in Fig. 3 . Table 3 summarizes the predicted volume fractions and chemical compositions of equilibrium phases at 800°C. Apparently, the phase diagrams of the alloys look very similar: the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys are supposed to solidify through a single bcc_A2 phase and below certain temperature fcc_C15 (Laves) phase precipitates from the bcc solid solution phase. The fraction of Laves phase continuously increases with the decrease of temperature. Yet, the Al content pronouncedly affects the predicted characteristic phase transformations temperatures. For example, the solidus temperatures of the alloys increase from 1384°C in the CrNbTiVZr alloy to 1464°C in the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy, while the respective Laves phase solvus temperatures are 1233°C and 923°C. The decrease of Laves phase solvus temperature means that at given temperature fraction of Laves phase will be higher in alloy with lower Al content. For example, at 800°C, the predicted fraction of Laves phase in the CrNbTiVZr alloy is 0.27, while in the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy the respective value is 0.10 ( Table 3 ). According to the predictions, the fcc_C15 (Laves) phase is mainly composed of Cr and Nb, while the bcc_A2 phase predominantly consists of the remaining elements ( Table 3 ).",['f0015'],"['t0015', 't0015', 't0015']"

The presented values demonstrate that increase of Al content results in a gradual decrease of the density of the alloys from 6590kgm−3of the CrNbTiVZr alloy to 6250kgm−3of the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy. Using the rule of mixtures and densities of the constitutive elements, the densities of the studied alloys were calculated using the following formula:(1)ρmix=∑Aici/∑Aici/ρiwhereAi,ci, andρiare atomic weight, concentration, and density of theielement.

The CrNbTiVZr alloy has microhardness of 520HV, which increases to 650HV for the Al0.25CrNbTiVZr alloy. However, further increment in Al concentration has the relatively weak effect on the microhardness: the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy has a microhardness of 670HV.",[],['t0025']
3.3,Results.Density and Mechanical Properties of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) Alloys,"Engineering stress-train curves obtained during the compression tests of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys at T=22–1000°C are presented in Fig. 4 . The resulting mechanical properties, namely yield stress (σYS), peak stress (σP) and fracture strain (ε), are summarized in Table 6 . At temperatures of 22°C and 600°C, the studied alloys are brittle and fracture occurs in the elastic region of the stress-strain curves ( Fig. 4 a, b, Table 6 ). Thus the obtained mechanical properties are not representative. At 800°C, the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5) alloys can be plastically deformed to ε=50% ( Fig. 4 c) whereas the ductility of the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy is very low - 0.3% ( Table 6 ). The yield strength of the alloys increases with an increase in Al content from 440MPa for the CrNbTiVZr alloy to 1250MPa for the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy ( Table 6 ). The strengthening stage of the stress-strain curves of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5) alloys is short, and peak stress is reached soon after yielding. The pronounced softening stage is observed then, followed by prolonged steady-state flow stage ( Fig. 4 c). At T=1000°C, all the studied alloys can be plastically deformed to 50% without fracture ( Fig. 4 d, Table 6 ). The yield strength of the alloys significantly reduces to 95MPa of the CrNbTiVZr alloy and to 305MPa of the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy ( Table 6 ). The shapes of stress-strain curves at 1000°C are almost identical to those of 800°C, yet the softening stage is more pronounced ( Fig. 4 d).","['f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020']","['t0030', 't0030', 't0030', 't0030', 't0030', 't0030']"
4.1,Discussion.Structure of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) Alloys,"The presented results on the structure of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys demonstrate that Al significantly affects the phase composition of the alloys, however, in the quite unexpected way: it does not stabilize the solid solution nor (pronouncedly) increases the fraction of intermetallic phases. Instead, in the Al-containing alloys the fcc Laves phase of the CrNbTiVZr alloy is transformed into two hcp Laves phases with different chemical compositions ( Figs. 1 –2,Tables 1–2). The overall fraction of intermetallic phases is slightly increased due to Al addition ( Table 2 ). Interestingly, the Al content (at least, in the examined concentrations) does not affect the fraction of the constitutive phases and changes only their chemical compositions ( Table 2 ). Thermo-Calc calculations predict that the alloys should be composed of bcc and (probably) C15 fcc Laves phase and volume fraction of Laves phase should continuously decrease with the increase of Al content ( Fig. 3 , Table 3 ). The thermodynamic predictions contradict a lot of experimental results. Although it is already well established that thermodynamic modeling does not always give correct predictions for complexly concentrated HEAs due to limitations of existing databases[29,32], reasonable agreement between experiment and simulations was observed in the case of the CrNbTiVZr alloy previously[18]. Therefore, it's worth to analyze the reasons for disagreement in experimental and predicted phase composition of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys.","['f0015', 'f0005', 'f0010']","['t0010', 't0010', 't0015', 't0005', 't0010']"
4.1,Discussion.Structure of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) Alloys,"Apparently, the crystal structure and fractions of the constitutive phases of the alloy of given composition in certain equilibrium condition will depend on the chemical composition of the phases. Therefore, it seems possible that the incorrect thermodynamic predictions of the phase composition of the Al-containing AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys can be ascribed to inaccurate assessment of the distribution of elements between the constitutive phases. Comparison between the experimental and predicted chemical compositions of the phases (Tables 2 and 3respectively) clearly shows that there is a big difference which cannot be attributed to changed temperatures (the experimental alloys were annealed at 1200°C and predicted equilibrium compositions at 800°C is given in Table 3 ). To illustrate this difference better, we have calculated partitioning coefficients,ky, of each element for experimentally observed ( Table 2 ) and thermodynamically predicted ( Table 3 ) phases in accordance with the following formula:(2)ky=cyLavescybccwherecyLavesandcybccare the concentrations of the elementyin the corresponding phases ( Fig. 5 ). In the case of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys, the concentration of elements in the C14 ZrCrAl-type Laves phase were used as the experimental values. The partitioning behavior of the alloying elements is quite correctly predicted in case of CrNbTiVZr alloy, where Cr strongly partitions to the C15 fcc Laves phase. This finding correlates well with correct predictions of the phase composition of the CrNbTiVZr alloy[18]. Very similar partitioning coefficients are predicted for the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys ( Fig. 5 b). Note that according to predictions the Al should be found predominantly in bcc phase. However, the experimental results show very different behavior ( Fig. 5 a). First of all, in the experimental Al-containing alloys Al tends to the Laves phase. Moreover, the partitioning coefficient for Cr becomes considerably smaller, whereas the coefficient for Zr pronouncedly increases with the increase of the Al content in the alloys. These results altogether suggest the chemical composition of the Laves and bcc phases in the Al-containing AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys is predicted incorrectly during Thermo-Calc calculations with currently used database and therefore the crystal structures and fractions of predicted phases do not fit the experimental results. The results also show that the Al concentration in the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys strongly affects the partitioning of the elements between the Laves and bcc phases. Most likely, the volume fractions of constitutive phases in the Al-containing alloys remain nearly the same ( Table 2 ) despite pronounced changes in the alloys' compositions due to difference in partitioning behavior.","['f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025']","['t0015', 't0010', 't0015', 't0010', 't0010', 't0015']"
4.1,Discussion.Structure of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) Alloys,"Some clues to the understanding of the effect of Al on phase composition of the studied AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys can be found in previous experience on simpler alloys which are also composed predominantly of Laves phase(s). The change of the polytype of the Laves phase from fcc C15 to hcp C14 due to Al addition was previously observed in several systems with Laves phases[37–42]. Particularly, in the Cr-Al-Nb system, Al partially substitutes Cr in binary Cr2Nb phase and changes a polytype of Laves phase from C15 to C14. A replacement of Cr atoms by Al atoms happens preferentially on the 2a sites of the C14 lattice, which are completely occupied by Cr atoms in the binary systems[41]. As the control over C15/C14 Laves phase polytypes is essential due to their different functional and mechanical properties[37,39,42,43]several factors were proposed for the C15/C14 abundance, which include average electron density (e/a), geometric atomic size ratio, and difference in electronegativity[44,45]. It was demonstrated that the average electron density (e/a) is the most influential parameter in determining the C15/C14 phase abundance: ase/aincreased, C15/C14 became more/less dominant, respectively[45]. The actuale/avalues for the switch from C15 to C14 phases were found to depend on the alloys' compositions[45]. Notably, the analysis was performed only for binary and ternary Laves phases while predictions of different polytypes of compositionally-complex Laves phases in high-entropy alloys have never been performed yet. Therefore, to verify the role of average electron density,e/a, in controlling the C15/C14 phase abundance, we have calculated thee/avalue (for transition metal Laves phasese/a=VEC[43,44,46],VECis the valence electron concentration), for the C15 Laves and C14 phases (chemical compositions of the corresponding phases are given in Table 2 ) of the studied AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys and the CrNbTiZr alloy (the chemical composition of the C15 Laves phase in the CrNbTiZr alloy is reported in[18]) in accordance with the following formula:(3)e/a=∑cie/aiwhereci– atomic fraction of elementi,e/ai=VECiis the average electron density of elementi. The dependence between the polytype of the Laves phase found in the alloys and the respectivee/avalues is plotted in Fig. 6 . Clearly the fcc C15 Laves phase is found at highere/avalues and at lowere/avalues the hcp C14 Laves phase is observed. This is the indication that the same factors govern the C15/C14 Laves phase abundance in the currently studied HEAs and less complex Laves-phase containing alloys. Fig. 6 also demonstrates that transition between C14 and C15 phases occurs ate/ain the range of 4.865–5.023. Comparison with the results for the “conventional” alloys[45]suggests that the Al-Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr system HEAs with thee/avalues within the identified range can be composed of different Laves phases simultaneously, however, this suggestion requires additional experimental verification.","['f0030', 'f0030']",['t0010']
4.1,Discussion.Structure of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) Alloys,"The decreasede/avalues of the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys can be well understood from the observed partitioning behavior ( Fig. 5 a). Indeed, the elements with relatively highVEC(=e/a) such as Cr (VEC=6) and V (VEC=5) are replaced with Zr (VEC=4) and Al (VEC=3). The strong chemical affinity between Al and Zr (ΔHmix=−43.7kJ/mol−1[47]) is likely the reason why they are found in the same phase. However, additional studies, probably, involving first-principle calculations, are required to identify the reasons why Al and Zr prefer to partition to Laves phase contrary to thermodynamic predictions which suggest that they should be found mostly in bcc phase ( Fig. 5 b). Another question for further concerns are the reasons for the formation of two types of C14 Laves phase in the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys.","['f0025', 'f0025']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Mechanical Properties of the AlxCrNbTiVZr Alloys,"The mechanical behavior of the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys was found to be significantly dependent on both composition (Al concentration) and testing temperature ( Fig. 4 , Table 6 ). At 22°C and 600°C, the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys without regard to Al concentration exhibited brittle fracture, which has not allowed to obtain representative data on the compressive strength of the alloys and only microhardness is available as a measure of the strength of the alloys. High brittleness of the alloys which contain 53–67 (vol.)% of intermetallic Laves phase(s) at low temperatures is not surprising. At 800°C, the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5) alloys demonstrate pronounced plastic deformation capacity, which is the indication that brittle-to-ductile transition occurs in the alloys at temperature(s) in the range of 600–800°C. The AlCrNbTiVZr alloy becomes ductile only at 1000°C, which suggests the brittle-to-ductile temperature in the range of 800–1000°C.",['f0020'],['t0030']
4.2,Discussion.Mechanical Properties of the AlxCrNbTiVZr Alloys,"It seems reasonable to analyze the relationship between the composition, structure and mechanical properties of the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys. According to results of previous studies[29,31,32], two major strengthening mechanisms were suggested to operate in the Al-Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr system HEAs: (i) solid-solution(-like) strengthening, for example, by Al or Cr atoms[29,32], (ii) strengthening by second (Laves) phase particles, which is generally proportional to their volume fraction[29,31,32]. In addition, it was supposed that change of polytype of the Laves phase from fcc C15 to hcp C14 can also contribute to the strengthening of the alloys[38,43]. It is necessary to point out that the Al-containing AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys have almost identical microstructures in terms of volume fractions and crystal structures of constitutive phases ( Table 2 ). At the same time, the microhardness values of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys are almost identical ( Table 5 ), while the microhardness of the CrNbTiVZr alloy with a lower fraction of Laves phase is substantially lower. Therefore, an increase of microhardness in the Al-doped alloys can be attributed to the increase of volume fraction of the Laves phase and, probably, change of crystal structure of the Laves phase.",[],"['t0010', 't0025']"
4.2,Discussion.Mechanical Properties of the AlxCrNbTiVZr Alloys,"However, the yield strength of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5) alloys at 800°C and 1000°C continuously increases with the increase of Al concentration in the alloys ( Table 6 ). As the volume fraction of Laves phases in the Al-containing alloys are almost identical, the fractions of constitutive phases do not seem to have a decisive effect on the mechanical strength of the alloys. This finding can be interpreted in the following way. The bcc solid solution most probably has negligibly low strength in comparison with the Laves phase at high temperatures[29,32], and taking into account (i) high volume fraction of Laves phase exceeding 50% (ii) continuous network formed by Laves phase particles/grains ( Fig. 2 b–h) it might be assumed that the behavior of the whole alloy is controlled solely by mechanical response of Laves phase(s). The fraction of soft bcc solid solution does not affect the resulting strength of the alloy. In turn, an increase of Al concentration in the alloys results in a continuous increase of Al content in Laves phase(s) ( Table 2 ). The alloying with Al can result in the solid solution-like strengthening of the Laves phase(s) and therefore the whole alloy. Note that the solid solution strengthening even in single solid solution structured HEAs is not completely understood at the moment[10,23,25,28], and the exact mechanism(s) of strengthening of complexly concentrated ordered Laves phase due to increased Al concentration can be very complex. The continuous monotonic increase of strength of the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys with an increase ofxalso does not support the suggestion that the crystal structure of Laves phase(s) affects the properties of the alloys, at least, at elevated temperatures.",['f0010'],"['t0030', 't0010']"
4.2,Discussion.Mechanical Properties of the AlxCrNbTiVZr Alloys,"Together with the strengthening, addition of Al decreases the density of the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys ( Table 4 ) which should lead to a pronounced increase in the specific strength. We have calculated the specific yield strength (SYS) of the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys at 800°C and 1000°C and compared it with that of some HEAs based on the Al-Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr system, some other HEAs based on refractory elements and commercial Ni-based alloys ( Fig. 7 ). At 800°C, the SYS of the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys almost linearly increases with an increase in Al content from ≈67kPam3kg−1of the CrNbTiVZr alloy to 200kPam3kg−1of the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy. At 1000°C, the SYS values retain a threefold difference between the CrNbTiVZr and AlCrNbTiVZr alloys but the ones drop drastically to ≈14kPam3kg−1of the CrNbTiVZr alloy and to ≈49kPam3kg−1of the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy. A comparative analysis of the SYS of the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys and other HEAs reveal that, at 800°C, the SYS value of the equiatomic AlCrNbTiVZr alloy (200kPam3kg−1) comparable with that of the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy (≈216kPam3kg−1), which is considered as the strongest HEA based on refractory elements up to date. However, at 1000°C, the SYS value of the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy (≈49kPam3kg−1) does not exceed not only that of the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy (≈101kPam3kg−1) but also the NbCrMo0.5Ta0.5TiZr alloy (≈66kPam3kg−1). Nevertheless, the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy is found to be the strongest alloy among the reported alloys of the Al-Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr system (AlNbTiV[28], NbTiVZr[32]AlCr1.5NbTiV[29], Al1.5NbTiVZr[32]). Note also that the specific strength of the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy at 800°C is ≈2 times higher than that of the commercial Ni-based superalloys.",['f0035'],['t0020']
4.2,Discussion.Mechanical Properties of the AlxCrNbTiVZr Alloys,"Very high specific strength at temperatures ≤800°C can make the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys attractive for high-temperature structural applications. However, the alloys suffer from brittleness at relatively high temperatures of 600–800°C. This evidentially limits their potential applications. Therefore, in order to make the developed HEAs suitable for structural applications, it is necessary to enhance their ductility. It seems possible that decrease in volume fraction of brittle Laves phase can increase the ductility of the alloy. Experimental data and thermodynamic simulations[18,29,32]suggest that the volume fraction of Laves phase can be controlled either by adjusting chemical composition of the alloy or by proper heat treatment. However, there is a high probability that the alloy with a lower fraction of Laves phase (below 50%) and the bcc matrix will be considerably softer, especially at high temperatures. Therefore, development of the Al-Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr system HEAs with the optimal combination of properties requires further studies.",[],[]
5,Conclusions,"In this study, the effect of Al on the structure and mechanical properties of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) high-entropy alloys after annealing at 1200°C for 24h was examined. Following conclusions were made:1)The CrNbTiVZr alloy is composed of bcc and C15 (fcc) Laves phases with volume fractions of 42% and 58% according to EBSD data while the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys consist of bcc and two C14 (hcp) Laves phases with different chemical compositions. The volume fractions of C14 (hcp) Laves phases in the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys are equal to 67% and are independent on Al content.2)The thermodynamic modeling of the AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys predicts the existence of only bcc and C15 Laves phases in the alloys and broader single bcc phase field in alloys with higher Al content which contradicts the experimental data. The discrepancy between experimentally observed and thermodynamically predicted phase compositions of the Al-containing AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys is attributed to incorrectly predicted partitioning behavior of the constitutive elements.3)The change of polytype of the Laves phases from fcc C15 to hcp C14 in the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys is associated with the decrease of the average electron density,e/a, of corresponding phases due to increased Al and Zr concentrations. It is suggested that transition between C15 and C14 Laves phase polytypes in Al-Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr alloys occurs whene/ais in the range of 4.865–5.023.4)The AlxCrNbTiVZr (x=0; 0.25; 0.5; 1) alloys were found to be extremely fragile at room temperature and 600°C. The AlCrNbTiVZr has very low ductility even at 800°C and becomes ductile only at 1000°С, while the alloys with lower Al content can be compressed to 50% stain without fracture at 800°C and 1000°C. The strength of the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys at 800°C and 1000°C substantially increases with Al content. For example, at 800°C, the yield strength of CrNbTiVZr alloy is 440MPa while the AlCrNbTiVZr demonstrates the strength of 1250MPa. At 1000°C, the yield strength drastically decreases to 95MPa for the CrNbTiVZr alloy and to 305MPa for the AlCrNbTiVZr alloy. The specific yield strength of AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys at temperature 800°C and 1000°C was found to be highly competitive to the other high-entropy alloys and commercial nickel-based superalloys.",[],[]
