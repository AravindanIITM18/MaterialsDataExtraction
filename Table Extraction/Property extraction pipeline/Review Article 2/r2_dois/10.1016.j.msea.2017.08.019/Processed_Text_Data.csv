0,Abstract,"Structure and mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrx (x = 0; 0.1; 0.25; 0.5; 1; 1.5) refractory high-entropy alloys were investigated after arc melting and annealing at 1200°C for 24h. The AlNbTiV alloy had a B2 ordered single phase structure. Alloying with Zr resulted in (i) change of the degree of order of the B2 phase; and (ii) precipitation of the Zr5Al3 and C14 Laves ZrAlV phases. The density of the AlNbTiVZrx alloys varied from 5590kgm−3 for the AlNbTiV alloy to 5870kgm−3 for the AlNbTiVZr1.5 alloy. The compression yield strength at 22°C increased with an increase in the Zr content from 1000MPa for the AlNbTiV alloy to 1535MPa for the AlNbTiVZr1.5 alloy. The plasticity raised from 6% for the AlNbTiV alloy to >50% for the AlNbTiVZr0.5 alloy and then dropped to 0.4% for the AlNbTiVZr1.5 alloy. At 600°C, the strongest alloy was also the AlNbTiVZr1.5, whereas, at 800°C, the AlNbTiVZr0.1 alloy demonstrated the maximum strength. The plasticity of the AlNbTiV alloy at 600°C increased up to 14.3%, while the Zr-containing alloys had lower plasticity. At 800°C, all the AlNbTiVZrx alloys could be plastically deformed up to 50% of strain without fracture. Ordering in the alloys and the reasons of a complicated dependence of mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrx alloys on the Zr content and temperature were discussed.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"So-called high-entropy alloys (HEAs) provide a new tempting approach to creation and elaboration of materials with outstanding properties[1–3]. According to the original definition[1], HEAs composed of 5 or more principal elements taken into equiatomic or nearly equiatomic proportions. However, alloys with four constitutive elements can also be considered as HEAs.[4–9]. Conversion from a single-basic-element approach to the multi-component one allows the development of new alloys with highly promising properties for various potential applications[5,7,10,11]. For example, refractory HEAs introduced by Senkov et al. in 2010 demonstrated very high strength up to 1600°C[5]. However, the density of these HEAs (> 10g/cm3) is noticeably higher than that of commercial superalloys. The necessity to decrease the density of these alloys served as a trigger for the developing new light-weight refractory HEAs[6–8,12–16].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Obvious approaches to develop refractory HEAs with low weight are: (i) using elements with high melting points and relatively low density (like Cr, Nb, Ti, V, Zr) and (ii) adding light-weight metals such as Al. Stepanov et al.[8]introduced an equiatomic single phase AlNbTiV alloy with the density of 5.59g/cm3. This alloy exhibited surprisingly high specific strength up to 800°C but poor plasticity at room temperature. Aluminum was thought to be responsible for the properties demonstrated by the AlNbTiV alloy[8]. Addition of Cr to the AlNbTiV alloy has resulted in the formation of Laves phase particles and further increase in the strength at room and elevated temperatures[13]. However, room temperature ductility of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys decreased pronouncedly with an increase in the Cr content. In contrast, alloying the AlNbTiV alloy with 0.5M fraction of Zr provided a drastic increase in the room-temperature plasticity[14]. This is an interesting finding since the alloy possesses good plasticity despite a relatively high amount (~15vol%) of intermetallic phases. The reasons for a considerable growth in plasticity of the AlNbTiV alloy at ambient temperature in the presence of Zr were not clarified so far. In the current study an effort to elucidate this issue was made. For that purpose, structure of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys with different Zr content was analyzed and the effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiV alloy was evaluated.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The alloys with a nominal composition of AlNbTiV, AlNbTiVZr0.1, AlNbTiVZr0.25, AlNbTiVZr0.5, AlNbTiVZr, and AlNbTiVZr1.5were produced by arc melting of the elements in a low-pressure, high-purity argon atmosphere inside a water-cooled copper cavity. The purities of the alloying elements were no less than 99.9at%. The produced ingots of the alloys measured ~6 × 12 × 40mm3. As-cast ingots were annealed at 1200°C for 24h. Prior to the annealing, the samples were incapsulated in vacuumed (10−2Torr) quartz tubes filled with titanium chips to prevent any oxidation.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Microstructure and phase composition of the alloys after annealing at 1200°C were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The XRD analysis was performed using RIGAKU diffractometer and CuKα radiation. The obtained XRD data were also used for calculation of a long-range order parameter (LROP) of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys in accordance with the following equation:(1)LROP=(Isl/Ifund)(Lpfund/Lpsl)(Ffund/Fsl),whereIslandIfundare the intensities of the superlattice reflection and the fundamental reflection peaks from the alloy, respectively;LpslandLpfundare parameters which include the Lorentz and the polarization factors and the geometry of the X-ray diffraction recording:(2)Lpfund=(1-cos22θfund)/(sin2θfundsinθfund);Lpsl=(1-cos22θsl)/(sin2θslsinθsl),whereθslandθfundare the Bragg angles for the fundamental and superlattice reflections, respectively; andFfundandFslare the structure factors for the fundamental and superlattice lines, respectively. For the stoichiometric (50:50) composition of a B2 phase, the structure factors for the fundamental and superlattice lines are calculated as follows:(3)Ffund=fA,fund+fB,fund;Fsl=fA,sl−fB,sl,wherefAandfBare the atomic scattering factors for A and B elements, respectively. In the case of AlNbTiVZrxalloys, it is impossible to define a stoichiometric composition of the B2 phase due to the simultaneous presence of a variety of constitutive elements. Therefore, based on a number of earlier studies[17–25]about the site occupations of alloying elements in ordered Ti alloys, the Ti sublattice (i.e. A sites) was assumed to be occupied with Ti, Nb and Zr, while Al and V enter into the Al sublattice (i.e. B sites). The final formula for the calculation of the LROP of the B2 phase in the AlNbTiVZrxalloys can be written as:(4)LROP=(Isl/Ifund)(Lpfund/Lpsl)((fA,fund*+fB,fund*)2/(fA,sl*-fB,sl*)2),Wheref*A= fTi(cTi/(cTi+cNb))+fNb(cNb/(cTi+cNb))+fZr(cZr/(cTi+cZr));f*B= fAl(cAl/(cAl+cV))+fV(cV/(cAl+cV));cTi,cNb,cZr,cAl, andcVare the concentrations of the constitutive elements in the matrix phase, taken from Table 2 .",[],['t0010']
2,Experimental procedures,"Samples for SEM observations were prepared by mechanical polishing. SEM investigations were carried out using either FEI Quanta 600 FEG or Nova NanoSEM microscopes; both instruments were equipped with energy-dispersive (EDS) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) detectors. The volume fraction of different phases was measured by a Digimizer Image Analysis Software using SEM-BSE images. Mechanically pre-thinned to 100µm foils were prepared for TEM analysis by conventional twinjet electro-polishing at temperature of − 35°C and an applied voltage of 29.5V in a mixture of 600ml of methanol, 360ml of butanol and 60ml of perchloric acid. TEM investigations were performed using a JEOL JEM-2100 apparatus equipped with an EDS detector at an accelerating voltage of 200kV.",[],[]

The intensity of the Bragg peaks associated with the Laves phase of ZrAlV-type gradually increased with an increase in the Zr content ( Fig. 1 ).

The AlNbTiV alloy had a single phase coarse-grained structure with the average size of ~300µm and the nominal chemical composition ( Fig. 3 a and Table 2 ). TEM investigation ( Fig. 3 b) has revealed the presence of thermal antiphase domains (APD). A selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern had shown the presence of (100) superlattice maxima which suggested the ordering of the B2 phase; this finding was consistent with the XRD data ( Fig. 1 ).","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0005']","['t0010', 't0010']"

This secondary phase was found to be enriched with Zr and Al ( Table 2 ). The same phase was also found in the AlNbTiVZr0.25alloy ( Fig. 3 d) either in the form of a continuous network along the matrix grain boundaries or as individual particles inside grains. The volume fraction of this phase in the AlNbTiVZr0.25alloy was ≈5% ( Table 2 ).,"['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']","['t0010', 't0010']"
3.1,Results.Structure of the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0; 0.1; 0.25; 0.5; 1; 1.5) alloys,"The AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy demonstrated a three-phase structure composed of a matrix phase (marked as 1 in Fig. 3 e), light-gray particles enriched with Zr and Al (marked as 2 in Fig. 3 e) and dark-gray particles, enriched with Zr, Al, and V (marked as 3 in Fig. 3 e). The two last phases have been identified using TEM analysis as the Zr5Al3-type phase and C14 Laves phase of ZrAlV-type (the corresponding TEM micrograph and SAED pattern are not shown), respectively ( Fig. 3 f). TEM studies also revealed the presence of the APD and B2 ordering of matrix, like those in the AlNbTiV alloy ( Fig. 3 b). Both the Zr5Al3-type and ZrAlV-type phases were predominantly located along grain boundaries of the matrix phase as discontinuous chains of particles; however, some particles of the Zr5Al3-type phase were observed inside B2 grains. The volume fraction of the matrix phase, Zr5Al3-type phase, and ZrAlV-type Laves phase were found to be 85 ± 2, 5 ± 1 and 10 ± 2%, respectively.

Zr resulted in a gradual increase in the density of the alloys from 5590kgm−3for the AlNbTiV alloy to 5870kgm−3for the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy.

3.2,Results.Density and mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0; 0.1; 0.25; 0.5; 1; 1.5) alloys," Fig. 4 displays engineering stress-strain curves of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys obtained during compression at 22–800°C; the resulting mechanical properties are summarized in Table 4 and Fig. 5 . At 22°C the yield strength of the alloys pronouncedly increased with an increase in Zr content. However, the increment of strength occurred non-monotonically; rapidly increased from 1000MPa for the AlNbTiV alloy to 1485MPa for the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy and then slightly rose to 1535MPa for the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy. Besides, fast strengthening was observed in the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0; 0.1) alloys, whereas strengthening of the alloys with the higher Zr content occurred much slower. Plasticity of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys showed a complicated dependence on the Zr content. The AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0; 0.1; 0.25; 1; 1.5) alloys demonstrated low plasticity at room temperature; these alloys fractured at height reductions in a range from 0.4% for the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy to 9.3% for the AlNbTiVZr0.25alloy ( Figs. 4 a and5, Table 4 ). However, the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy exhibited high compression plasticity – over 50% ( Figs. 4 a and5, Table 4 ). Several drops of flow stress at the stress-strain curve of the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy ( Fig. 4 a), which most likely were associated with cracking, are noteworthy. Careful macroscopic examination of the sample after the compression test revealed the presence of surface cracks. However, SEM microscopic analysis showed the formation of cracks within second phase particles only; these cracks did not propagate to the matrix. In turn, TEM investigation ( Fig. 6 ) of the compressed sample has discovered that the structure of the matrix phase was a simple disordered bcc instead of the ordered B2 as in the initial state ( Fig. 3 f). The matrix phase of the alloy was chopped into rhomb-shaped areas by crossing deformation bands inclined by ~60° from the compression axis; in addition dense dislocation walls and pile-ups were observed in the microstructure.","['f0020', 'f0025', 'f0020', 'f0025', 'f0020', 'f0025', 'f0020', 'f0030', 'f0015']","['t0020', 't0020', 't0020']"
3.2,Results.Density and mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0; 0.1; 0.25; 0.5; 1; 1.5) alloys,"An increase in testing temperature to 600°C resulted in somewhat lower strength of the alloys ( Figs. 4 b and5, Table 4 ). Similar to the room temperature behavior the yield strength of the alloys increased with the Zr content; the yield strength of the AlNbTiV and AlNbTiVZr1.5alloys was found to be 780 and 1195MPa, respectively. Strain hardening occurred in rather similar manner for all alloys with different Zr content. The increased temperature also results in plasticity enhancement of the AlNbTiV and AlNbTiVZr0.1alloys. However, the alloys with the molar fraction of Zr ≥ 0.25 became less plastic. The most significant reduction in plasticity was observed for the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy, which fractured at 7.5% of strain. In general, plasticity of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys at 600°C decreased with an increase in Zr content from 14.3% for the AlNbTiV alloy to 0% for the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy.","['f0020', 'f0025']",['t0020']

The yield strength slightly increased from 560MPa to 855–865MPa with an increase in the molar fraction of Zr in the range of 0–0.1–0.25 and then monotonically decreases to 180MPa with a further increment of the Zr content to the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy.

4.1,Discussion.Effect of Zr on the structure of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"The microstructure analysis of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys with different Zr content, performed in the current study, has revealed several features. First, an increase in the Zr content substantially decreased the LROP of the matrix B2 phase of the alloys ( Fig. 3 ). Second, an addition of Zr resulted in the formation of intermetallic phases, namely the Zr5Al3-type phase and the Laves phase of ZrAlV-type (Tables 1, 2). The latter quite expected finding can be associated with a highly negative enthalpy of intermetallic phases formation in respective Zr-X binaries, where X are the other constituents (e.g. Al; for instance, the enthalpy of the binary Zr5Al3-type phase formation was −51.5kJmol−1[28]). However, the B2 ordering of the matrix phase and the dependence of the LROP on the Zr content deserve more detailed discussion.",['f0015'],"['t0005', 't0010']"
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Zr on the structure of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"The B2 ordering is often observed in Al-containing high-entropy alloys[29–34]. Al was found to be a bcc/B2 stabilizer in those HEAs which are based on late transition metals (TMs) such as Fe, Ni, Co and Cu[29–35]. Having a high electron density (the outermost shell holds three electrons) and a high Fermi level (small work-function and high ionization tendency), Al prefers to transfer electrons to TMs, such as Ni, Co, Fe, Cr and Mn, to form intermetallic compounds with covalent bonds between the elements[36].",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Zr on the structure of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"Meanwhile, the role of Al in HEAs based on refractory metals is not well-established so far. In a number of Al-containing refractory HEAs[11,12,15,37–39], the B2 ordering was not observed, and only a few studies[40,41]revealed the formation of the B2 phase in the presence of Al. Particularly, the B2 phase in the AlCrTiV alloy was shown to be more thermodynamically stable than the disordered bcc[41]whereas some other Al-containing refractory HEAs (e.g. AlxNbTiMoV alloys[38]) were declared to be composed of single or several disordered bcc phases. This ambiguity can be partially ascribed to limitations of the techniques used for structural analysis. For instance, based on the XRD and SEM analysis the AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr alloy[11]was found to be consisted of two disordered bcc phases. Further study by advanced TEM techniques has revealed the presence of an Al-Zr-rich B2 phase in this alloy[40]. In the case of the AlNbTiV alloy, the B2 ordering was not found previously[8,13]most likely due to lower quality of XRD data and the absence of TEM examinations. Thus, it can be suggested that more detailed (i.e. using TEM) investigation are needed to discover the B2 ordering in other Al-containing alloys. However, as it will be discussed further, the degree of ordering can be considerably dependent on the exact chemical composition of the alloy and therefore some Al-containing refractory HEAs can have disordered structures. Nevertheless, based on the already existed experimental data, the formation of the ordered B2 matrix phase in the studied AlNbTiVZrxalloys can be attributed to the presence of Al.",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Zr on the structure of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"Moreover, the LROP parameter of the B2 phase in the AlNbTiVZrxalloys showed a pronounced dependence on the Zr content ( Fig. 3 ). The dependence of the LROP of the ordered phase(s) on the chemical composition of HEAs has never been revealed so far. The Al-induced B2 ordering was earlier found in some β-Ti alloys[17–25]. It was demonstrated that both the bcc/B2 transformation and the degree of the order of the B2 phase in those alloys were depended on the Al content[17]. In the case of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys, the Al concentration in the B2 phase decreased with an increase in the Zr content ( Table 2 ). The decrease in Al concentration in the B2 phase can be associated with: (i) the proportional decrease in the concentration of other (than Zr) constitutive elements of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys with the increase inX; (ii) preferred segregation of Al within the Zr-Al-rich intermetallic phases ( Table 2 ). However, in the case of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys, the LROP of the B2 phase was not in the direct proportion to the Al concentration. For example, the LROP decreased from 0.71 in the AlNbTiV alloy to 0.39 in the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy ( Fig. 3 ) that corresponded to the decrease in the Al content in the B2 matrix from 27.4at% to 21.0at% ( Table 2 ). However further decrease in the Al concentration in the B2 phase of the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy to 13.7at% resulted only in a slight change in the LROP of the B2 phase, which was equal to 0.37. The absence of a linear relationship between the Al concentration and the LROP can be ascribed to the complexity in site occupancy in the B2 phase, similar to that in Ti alloys[42]. In Ti alloys the excessive Ti or Zr atoms (usually taking the A-sites, i.e. body-centered positions) can occupy the B-sites, corresponding to the ordered B2 component. However, to evaluate the site occupancy in the AlNbTiVZrxalloys further in-depth study is needed.","['f0015', 'f0015']","['t0010', 't0010', 't0010']"
4.1,Discussion.Effect of Zr on the structure of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"Another interesting finding is the B2/bcc transition during the compression of the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy at 22°C ( Fig. 6 ). The order/disorder transition under deformation was often observed in binary intermetallic compounds with the B2 or L12structures[43–48]. The disordering is a result of the movement of superlattice dislocations which contain antiphase boundaries (APB)[43–48]. In turn, the energy of APB was found to be depended on the LROP[48–50]. A decrease in the LROP lowers the APB energy thereby reducing the slip resistance and facilitating the glide of unit dislocations of superlattice dislocations[48–50]. It implies that the deformation-induced disordering will proceed easier and faster in structures with a low LROP rather than in those with a high LROP. Therefore, it can be suggested that the lower LROP of the B2 phase in the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy is responsible for the B2-bcc transition under plastic deformation at room temperature.",['f0030'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"The Zr content (X)has a prominent effect on the mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys, as it can be expected from the pronounced changes in the microstructure.

4.2,Discussion.Effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"According to previous data[12,13,15], two strengthening mechanisms were suggested to operate in the Al-Cr-Nb-Ti-V-Zr system alloys: (i) solid solution strengthening (SSS) and (ii) second phases strengthening. As Zr has the largest atomic radii (rZr= 160p.m.) among the constituents of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys, it may cause the strongest SSS due to the lattice distortions. Several attempts were made to evaluate the SSS in HEAs[51,52]. These calculations gave reasonable agreement with the strength of disordered HEAs; however theoretical predictions are obviously inappropriate for ordered alloys like the AlNbTiVZrx. To evaluate the SSS in the studied alloys a relationship between the increment in the yield strength of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys Δσ(the difference between the yield strength of the Zr-containing alloys and the AlNbTiV alloy, Table 4 ), and the Zr concentration in the matrix B2 phasecZr( Table 2 )[53]was plotted using the power law-type function:(5)Δσ~cZrn",[],"['t0020', 't0010']"
4.2,Discussion.Effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"Atn= 0.5 a good fit was obtained between ΔσandcZrfor the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0; 0.1; 0.25; 0.5) alloys at T=22 and 600°C ( Fig. 7 ). The value ofn= 0.5 is typical for the classic Fleischer's approach for solid solution strengthening[54]. Therefore the strength increment in the AlNbTiVZrxalloys with an increase inXfrom 0 to 0.5 at both 22°C and 600°C is thought to be the result of the SSS in the matrix. This finding is in a reasonable agreement with the relatively low fraction of the second phase particles, which approaches to 15% in the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy ( Table 2 ). The morphology of the particles (large size, the preferred location at the grain boundaries) also suggests that they are unlikely making a pronounced contribution to the strength of the alloys.",['f0035'],['t0010']
4.2,Discussion.Effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"However, in the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0.5; 1; 1.5) alloys, the yield strength remains almost unchanged with an increase inX( Fig. 5 a). This fact can be associated with a large volume fraction of the second phases in the alloys. Notably, the strengthening contribution of the second phase particles to the B2 ordered alloys was shown to be very small as the matrix phase is already very hard[55]. Moreover, in the present case, the second phase particles can even cause a negative effect on the strength. According to Eq.(5), the yield strength of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys should increase steadily with an increase inXfrom 0 to 1.5 in proportion with the Zr content in the B2 matrix ( Table 2 ). But in the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0.5; 1; 1.5) alloys the increment of the strength of the matrix was compensated by some increase in the volume fraction of the presumably softer second phase particles ( Table 2 ) and strength of the alloys stabilized.",['f0025'],"['t0010', 't0010']"
4.2,Discussion.Effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"At 800°C the strength of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys increased forXin the range of 0–0.25 reaching the maximum atX=0.1 ( Fig. 5 a). However forXwithin the interval of 0.25–1.5 the strength of the alloys, in contrast to the lower temperatures, decreased reaching the strength of the single phase AlNbTiV alloy atX= 1 and drastically dropping to the minimum atX= 1.5 ( Fig. 5 a). The effect of SSS is known to become weaker with an increase in temperature[51]. It can be clearly seen from Fig. 7 that the slope of the Δσ - cZrline decreased with an increase in temperature from 22°C to 600°C. The SSS obviously became much weaker at 800°C since no correlation between ΔσandcZrfor the whole Zr concentration range was found ( Fig. 7 ). Thus some other factors controlling the yield strength of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys should be considered.","['f0025', 'f0025', 'f0035', 'f0035']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"In particular, one should keep in mind the ordered nature of the matrix phase and the changes in the LROP of the B2 phase. The strength of the ordered phases generally reduces with a lower rate with an increase in temperature in comparison with the strength of a disordered phase[56]. A high strength of the single phase AlNbTiV alloy at T=800°C can be caused by the ordered B2 structure. Apparently, the strength of the B2 compounds depended on the LROP. This dependence is rather complicated; the maximum strength is often observed at some intermediate LROP values rather than at the maximum ones[50]. This finding is associated with an easier dissociation of the superlattice dislocations into unit dislocations acting as effective hardening sources at lower LROP values[50]. It can be supposed that in the present AlNbTiVZrxalloys an increase in the yield strength at low Zr content (x = 0–0.25) was associated with two possible factors: (i) the SSS induced by Zr (which is weaker than at the lower temperatures, but still have some contribution) and (ii) changes in the LROP values of the matrix B2 phase ( Fig. 2 ). However, in general, a decrease in the ordering degree beyond the certain value should decrease the high-temperature strength of the alloy[50]. Thus, a decrease in the LROP observed in the AlNbTiVZrxalloys atX= 0.5, 1 or 1.5 ( Fig. 2 ) possibly reduced the energy of the connecting APB considerably; as a result unit dislocations of superdislocations can be considered as ordinary dislocations which can glide independently and which do not produce considerable hardening at high temperatures[50]. Another reason for the lower strength of the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0.5; 1; 1.5) alloys can be associated with a large volume fraction of the second phases which possibly become much softer than the B2 ordered matrix at elevated temperatures.","['f0010', 'f0010']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"The plasticity of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys shows a complicated dependence on the Zr content, especially at room temperature ( Fig. 5 b). The room temperature plasticity of the B2 alloys was dependent on the LROP; with a decrease in the ordering degree, the ductility increased[50]. A pronounced increase in the room temperature plasticity of the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy in comparison with the alloys with the lower Zr content can therefore be attributed to a pronounced decrease in the LROP ( Fig. 2 ). Although further increase in the Zr content resulted in some decrease in the LROP ( Fig. 2 ), the AlNbTiVZr and AlNbTiVZr1.5alloys demonstrated a poor plasticity at room temperature ( Fig. 5 b). It is reasonable to believe that a high volume fraction of the second phases, and associated difficulties in strain compatibility between the particles of different phases, can result in a rapid failure during compression of the alloys.","['f0025', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0025']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"At 600°C, only the AlNbTiV alloy demonstrated a pronounced increment in the plasticity ( Fig. 5 b). The plasticity of the Zr-containing alloys remained almost unchanged, with an exception of the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy; its plasticity reduced almost by an order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy still had the highest plasticity among the Zr-containing alloys. The reasons for lowered plasticity at 600°C remain unclear and need further in-depth study.",['f0025'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"With the further increase in the temperature to T=800°C, the AlNbTiVZrxalloys demonstrated high compression plasticity (≥50%) regardless of the Zr content ( Fig. 5 b). This can be considered as an indication of the brittle-to-ductile transition occurring in the alloys in the interval of 600–800°C. Most probably, the brittle-to-ductile transition is the consequence of an increase in dislocation mobility in the B2 ordered matrix with temperature increase.",['f0025'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Effect of Zr on mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys,"In summary, the present study identified that the ordering (LROP) of high-entropy alloys based on refractory metals can be controlled by the modifying their chemical composition. Moreover, the degree of order has pronounced effect on mechanical properties of the alloys (both strength and plasticity are strongly affected). These findings open new pathways to tailor the properties of the high entropy alloys and thus offer additional opportunities for the alloy development for various advanced applications, including high-temperature structural materials.",[],[]
5,Conclusions,"In this study, structure and mechanical properties of the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0; 0.1; 0.25; 0.5; 1; 1.5) refractory high-entropy alloys after annealing at 1200°C for 24h were examined. Following conclusions were made:1)The AlNbTiV alloy possessed the single phase ordered B2 structure. The ANbTiVZrx(x = 0.1; 0.25) alloys were composed of the B2 and hexagonal Zr5Al3-type phases. The phase composition of the AlNbTiVZrx(x = 0.5; 1; 1.5) alloys was presented by the B2 phase, Zr5Al3-type phase and hexagonal C14 Laves phase of ZrAlV-type. The volume fraction of the second phases increased with an increase in the Zr content from <1% for the AlNbTiVZr0.1alloy to 50% for the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy.2)The long-range order parameter (LROP) of the B2 phase was found to be depended on the Zr content. The LROP reduced with an increase in the Zr content from 0.71 for the AlNbTiV alloy to 0.37 for the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy.3)Zr resulted in a gradual increase in the density of the alloys from 5590kgm−3for the AlNbTiV alloy to 5870kgm−3for the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy.4)The strength of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys changed significantly with an increase in the Zr content. The values of the yield strength at 22°C raised rapidly from 1000MPa for the AlNbTiV alloy to 1485MPa for the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy, and from 780MPa to 1135MPa for the respective alloys at 600°C. The strength increment at T=22 and 600°C was associated with solid solution strengthening (SSS). Further increase in the Zr content did not result in a pronounced enhancement of strength: the yield strength of the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy was 1535MPa at 22°C and 1195MPa at 600°C, respectively. At 800°C, the maximum strength was demonstrated by the AlNbTiVZr0.1alloy, whereas the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy was the softest. A decrease in strength of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys at 800°C with an increase in the Zr content was associated with a lowering of the LROP of the B2 phase and a large fraction of the soft second phase particles.5)The plasticity of the AlNbTiVZrxalloys had a complex dependence on the Zr content. At 22°C, the plasticity increased from 6% for the AlNbTiV alloy to >50% for the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy. The plasticity enhancement was associated with a reduction of the LROP of the B2 phase. The plasticity then dropped to 0.4% for the AlNbTiVZr1.5alloy, supposedly due to the presence of a large volume fraction of the intermetallic second phases. At 600°C, the plasticity of the AlNbTiV alloy increased up to 14.3%, while the Zr-containing alloys had lower plasticity. At 800°C, all the AlNbTiVZrxalloys were plastically deformed up to 50% of strain without fracture.6)After compression test of the AlNbTiVZr0.5alloy at 22°C to 50% of height reduction, the initial B2 ordered matrix phase was found to be transformed into disordered bcc, i.e. plastic deformation of the alloy results in the B2-to-bcc transition.",[],[]
