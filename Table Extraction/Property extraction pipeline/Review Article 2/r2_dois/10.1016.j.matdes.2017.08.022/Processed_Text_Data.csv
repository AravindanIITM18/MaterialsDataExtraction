0,Abstract,"A novel HfZrTiTa0.53 high-entropy alloy (HEA) was fabricated by arc vacuum melting. The microstructure, mechanical behavior loaded at the initial strain rates from 1.0×10−3 to 2.2×103                     s−1 and energetic characteristics were studied. Results reveal that the alloy is composed of two phases with the same body-centered cubic (BCC) structure and similar lattice constant. Dispersed nano lamellar modulated structure inside equiaxed grain is derived from spinodal decomposition. Due to the co-contribution of solid solution strengthening and spinodal decomposition hardening, the quasi-static yield strength, compressive strength and fracture strain of HfZrTiTa0.53 alloy reach 786MPa, 1314 MPa and 13.5%, respectively. Strain rate strengthening effect is clearly observed in this alloy. In the dynamic regime, the alloy displays thermoplastic instability and deformation is strong localized in adiabatic shear bands and co-influenced by strain hardening, strain rate strengthening and thermal softening. Upon high-speed impact, the HfZrTiTa0.53 energetic projectiles were initiated and reacted with air to release a large quantity of energy. Excellent mechanical properties and high density, along with good energetic characteristics contribute to structural reliability, good penetrating performance and high energy release of HfZrTiTa0.53 HEA, demonstrating its great potential to be high strength energetic structural materials.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Energetic structural materials (ESMs) are a class of multifunctional reactive mixtures combining outstanding strength and energetic characteristics, including high density, high energy density and low sensitivity[1]. Such mixtures will be initiated upon impact loading and then release a large quantity of chemical energy through self-reaction or reaction with air[2]. Highly efficient damage can be obtained through the combination of mechanical damage derived from the conversion of kinetic energy and extra damage from the release of chemical energy.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"It is generally accepted that higher strength ensures the structural reliability and improves penetrating performance; greater density increases the kinetic energy and thus leads to better penetrating performance; greater reaction energy contributes to greater lethality. So far, high strength ESMs generally include two types: metal/metal (e.g. Al/Ta, W/Zr)[3–7]and metallic composites (e.g. Hf/Al composites)[8,9]. Meyers[7]reported that the Al/Ta alloy composed of two continuous phases of Ta and Al, possesses relatively high strength but limited ductility. Its yield strength under quasi-static and dynamic loading are 450MPa and 750MPa respectively. As reported by Ning[10], W/Zr alloy displays 1860MPa yield strength but only 1% fracture strain under quasi-static compression tests due to the formation of brittle W2Zr. When the initial strain rate reaches 1000s−1, the yield strength and fracture strain of W/Zr alloy are 2691MPa and 1.46%, respectively. The compressive yield strength of Hf/Al composite is 522MPa according to Grudza[11]. These materials are not sufficiently strong and ductile to be directly applied in high strength structural appliance, such as warheads, prefabricated fragments and explosively formed projectiles[6,7]. Thus, it is significant to find a new type of structural functional integration ESMs combining high strength, sufficient ductility, high density and good energetic characteristics.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Since firstly proposed in 2004[12,13], high-entropy alloys (HEAs), distinguished from the conventional alloys that are mainly based on one or two elements, comprising at least four major metallic elements[13,14], have always been under worldwide intensive research. It is found that the high mixing entropy of HEAs benefits the formation of solid solution with simple structure but the presence of complex intermetallics. The prominent solid solution hardening arising from severe lattice distortion generally renders HEAs with good mechanical properties and structural stability[15–17]. In addition, according to the rule of mixture, HEAs composed of highly-exothermic elements, such as Al, Mg, Ti, Zr, Hf and Ta, which are commonly used in metal/metal ESMs can be expected to release abundant energy when they react with air. Although HEAs composed of highly-exothermic elements have shown promising potential to be optimal candidates for high strength ESMs, large quantities of investigations on mechanical behavior of HEAs focus on quasi-static loading, dynamic mechanical properties are scarcely studied[18–21]and their energetic characteristics at high strain rates have not been reported yet. However, structural engineering alloys are likely to be subjected to versatile extreme conditions, including blasting shock, penetration, explosive welding molding, punching and high-speed cutting. It is thus necessary and significant to study the dynamic mechanical properties and their energetic characteristics at high strain rates.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In this study, a novel HfZrTiTa0.53HEA was fabricated and its microstructure, mechanical properties loaded under a wide range of initial strain rates and energetic characteristics were investigated.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"HfZrTiTa0.53alloy was prepared by vacuum arc melting from raw materials with purity of >99.9%, while the residual gases were absorbed by Ti getter. The as-prepared alloy was re-melted six times to achieve a homogeneous distribution of constituent elements. During each cycle, the sample was flipped and kept in a liquid state for ~5min. Crystal structure of the alloy was determined by X-ray diffractometer (XRD, Rigaku Dmax 2500) using Cu Kαtarget with a scanning rate of 3°/min and region between 20° and 100°. Microstructure was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fine structure observation and phase composition were performed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM Tecnai G2 F20) equipped with energy-dispersive (EDS) detector. Density of the alloy was measured via Archimedes drainage method. Vickers micro-hardness measurements were conducted under a load of 50g with the duration of 15s. Compression tests were performed on rectangular specimens with dimension of 5mm×5mm×9mm at an initial strain rate of 10−3s−1.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Dynamic loading tests were conducted using Split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system and cylindrical projectile with dimensions of Φ 8 mm×3 mm. In SHPB system, the striker, incident and transmitter bar are all with a diameter of 20mm and made of maraging steel which are 300, 1800 and 1200mm in length, respectively. When the cylindrical specimens are loaded by Split-Hopkinson pressure bar, the force applied to deformation region is calculated from the data collected by the strain gages on incident and transmitted bars. The engineering strain, engineering stress and strain rate can be obtained by the following equations[22]:(1)σ=AEA0εt(2)ε=−2c0l0∫0tεrdτ(3)ε̇=−2c0l0εrwhereEandc0are elastic modulus and elastic wave speed in the bar;Ais the cross-sectional area of the bar;A0andl0are the cross-sectional area and the length of the cylindrical specimens;εtandεrare the experimentally measured strain of incident and transmitted stress pulse on the bars respectively.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Cylindrical projectiles with dimensions of Φ 10mm×10mm, as shown in Fig. 1 a, were encapsulated in a nylon sabot and launched from 12.7mm ballistic gun. In the setup of ballistic experiment ( Fig. 1 b), the interval target includes a 1.5mm A3plate in the front and an armor chamber with 15mm in thickness in the back.","['f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructures,"Only one set of diffraction peaks corresponding to disordered body-centered cubic (BCC) structure are observed in the XRD pattern ( Fig. 2 a) of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy. The lattice constant is 343.7pm, similar to the one calculated by the rule of mixture[23](344.7pm) which also suggests random distribution of the elements. After etching, a homogeneous equiaxed grain structure and finer sub-grain structure inside the grains are observed in backscatter electron images ( Fig. 2 b). The TEM images of the alloy ( Fig. 2 c and d) show that the fine microstructure is the modulated structure composed of nano-lamellars which are nearly perpendicular with each other and display different contrast. This structure is a typical morphology of spinodal decomposition[24]and has been reported in other high entropy alloys[25–27]. The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern ( Fig. 2 e) further pointed out that the alloy is actually composed of two phases with both bcc structures (BCC1+BCC2) and very similar lattice constants (343.0 and 341.5pm respectively). According to the EDS results shown in Table 1 , the composition of large area in the matrix basically agrees with the theoretical value of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy. The BCC1 phase (lighter lamellas bisecting the gray/dark lamellas) is depleted with Ta and relatively rich in Ti while the BCC2 phase with very similar but relatively smaller lattice constant (gray/dark lamellas) shows clear Ta enrichment. It is also worth noting that the sum of proportion of Hf and Zr is nearly the same in the modulated structure.","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010']",['t0005']
3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructures,"Further analysis is conducted by High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) ( Fig. 3 ). As can be seen, due to its multi-composition essence and spinodal decomposition mode, obvious lattice distortions and high density dislocations were observed in Fig. 3 a. Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) of Fig. 3 a is displayed in Fig. 3 b and two sets of diffraction spots were observed which are respectively marked with squares (BCC1) and circles (BCC2), further confirming the results in SAED test. Inverse Fast Fourier Transformation (IFFT) of Fig. 3 a is displayed in Fig. 3 c and it is obvious that high density dislocations exist in the matrix (marked with red T-shape marker), which accommodate a large extent of strain.","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructures,"Unlike the other three elements in alloy which all possess hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures, Ta at room temperature (RT) is bcc structure ( Table 1 ). The structure of HfZrTiTa0.53is BCC instead of HCP, possibly resulting from the fact that during fast cooling there is not sufficient time for different atoms to move and the alloy thus maintains its structure under high temperature and contains severe lattice distortion and prominent strain accommodation at room temperature. Spinodal decomposition is a type of continuous phase transition decomposition and exists in alloy systems with solubility gap in the phase diagram. It occurs when a negative curvature exists in the Gibbs free energy of mixing between species, which leads to spontaneous composition of fluctuations of two phases. Unlike traditional precipitation, spinodal decomposition does not require particle nucleation, allowing extensive, uniform nanostructures to be obtained without long ageing. From the perspective of thermodynamics, Hf-Ta and Zr-Ta exhibit spinodal decomposition in solid phase region within their binary phase diagrams and the enthalpy of mixing of Hf-Ta, Zr-Ta and Ti-Ta are all positive, which suggests possible spinodal decomposition scheme within HfZrTi-Ta system and the segregation of Ta. In addition, highest melting temperature of tantalum and the fact that solute mobility scales with the homologous temperature[28]( Table 1 ) may jointly contribute to the clustering of Ta. Thus, fine modulated structure with large composition difference formed due to spinodal decomposition. The similarity of Hf and Zr both in topological and electronic properties leads to well-proportioned cluster of Hf and Zr and relatively even distribution in modulated structure.",[],"['t0005', 't0005']"
3.2,Results and discussion.Quasi-static mechanical properties,"Compressive engineering stress vs. engineering strain curves of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy at initial strain rates ranging from 1.0×10−3to 2.2×103s−1are shown in Fig. 4 . Under quasi-static loading condition (initial strain rate is 1.0×10−3s−1), the yield strength, ultimate compressive strength and fracture strain of the alloy are 774MPa, 1300MPa and 13.5% respectively. Its compression modulus, density and the Vickers microhardness are determined as 91GPa, 9.328gcm−3and 3720MPa respectively. As shown in the fracture surface images ( Fig. 5 a), three types of fracture surface regions were noted and marked using A, B and C which are respectively large dimples (region A), river patterns (region B) and shear separation traces (region C). Generally, large and deep dimples with a relatively uniform size distribute densely on the fracture surface ( Fig. 5 b) and are resulted from ductile fracture, while the river-like patterns ( Fig. 5 c) are caused by brittle fracture and shear separation traces are attributed to shear break separation. This phenomenon indicates the co-existence of ductile and brittle fracture mechanism of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy.","['f0020', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Quasi-static mechanical properties,"High hardness and strength of HfZrTiTa0.53HEA are mainly attributed to one of its intrinsic characteristics, namely, solid solution strengthening through severe lattice distortion[30]. In multi-element system, all constituent atoms with different sizes will interact with each other and elastically distort the crystal lattice, then induces the formation of a local elastic stress field and hinders dislocation movements, causing the increase of strength. Moreover, as shown in Table 1 , Ta has the highest shear modulus and leads to the largest deviation in the local forces. Mixture of two coherent phases with nano-lamellar structure along with the clustering of Ta also impedes the dislocation movement, contributing to the hardening. HfZrTiTa0.53alloy thus simultaneously exhibits high strength and sufficient ductility, which is critical for high strength ESMs as mentioned in the section of introduction. Compared with existing ESMs, including metal/metal fluoride (Al/PTFE)[31], metal/metal oxides (thermite)[32], metal/metal (Al/Ni)[7]and metallic composites ESMs, the strength and ductility of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy are both highly superior[6,7,11]. To better illustrate the advantages of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy as high strength ESMs, mechanical properties of representative existing ESMs mentioned above are listed in Table 2 . It is obvious that all existing ESMs mentioned here do not simultaneously satisfy the requirements of high strength and sufficient ductility, which renders strong advantages of HfZrTiTa0.53HEA in mechanical properties.",[],"['t0005', 't0010']"
3.3,Results and discussion.Dynamic mechanical properties,"The average strain rates of the specimens under dynamic compression tests are calculated using Eq.3which are 950, 1270, 1500 and 2200s−1respectively. The stress-strain curves obtained from Eq.1and Eq.2demonstrate the dynamic deformation and fracture behavior of the alloy. The compressive mechanical properties of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy at various initial strain rates are listed in Table 3 . Evident strain rate hardening can be discovered. As the initial strain increases from 0.001 to 2200s−1, the dynamic yield strength rises from 774 to 1469MPa and maintains nearly at the level of 1390MPa, and the compressive strength increases from 1300 to 1600MPa while the ductility always remains at the level of 9–13%.","['fo0015', 'fo0005', 'fo0010']",['t0015']
3.3,Results and discussion.Dynamic mechanical properties,"The specimen cracked but not completely broke at the initial strain rate of 950s−1. When the initial strain rate increased to higher than 950s−1, the alloy completely broke and reacted violently with the air, releasing bright light. Fig. 6 shows the macro fracture and micro fracture surface images of the specimen at the initial strain rate of 1500s−1. Obviously, a shear failure mode with a 49.6ofracture angle prevails in the final fracture. Fig. 6 b and c show that elongated shear dimples with relatively uniform size and equiaxial dimples with non-uniform size distribute densely and widely in the surface, which further confirms sufficient ductility discussed above of the alloy at high strain rates. In addition, as shown in Fig. 6 d, boundaries of the dimples were melted which indicates a large amount of heat production in the dynamic compressive process. One more thing worth pointing out is that small and shallow dimples ( Fig. 6 c) distribute in a line between two zones of large and deep dimples which may indicate the difference of ductility in different areas. Furthermore, we notice that the size of small dimple is similar to the width of sub-grain boundary in Fig. 2 b which are both a few microns. The linear distribution of small dimples between two zones of large dimples and similarity in size both suggest that small dimples are likely resulted from limited ductility in the sub-grain boundaries. The matrix within large grains has relatively higher ductility, leading to formation of larger and deeper dimples.","['f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0010']",[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Dynamic mechanical properties,"The fracture profile in Fig. 7 clearly show the formation of adiabatic shear band that is about 60oto the compressive direction and connects two cracks. In addition, in the middle of the profile, trace of the formation of adiabatic shear band that is 40oto the compressive direction is observed extending the whole specimen. Within the adiabatic shear bands, deformation occurs in the original grains and the grain boundaries appear filing along with the shear direction. The observation of adiabatic shear bands adjacent to the crack suggests that the formation of adiabatic shear bands are closely related to the crack and failure of the alloy at high strain rates which will be discussed further later.",['f0035'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Dynamic mechanical properties,"As shown in Fig. 4 , there are prominent differences between quasi-static and dynamic compressive curves. As for curves under dynamic scheme, there are several fluctuations in non-uniform plastic phase rather than the uniform plastic deformation stage under quasi-static scheme. The non-uniform fluctuations are likely derived from the competition between strain hardening, strain rate hardening and thermal softening effect. The sharp drop of engineering stress after break is likely to be related to a transition in the deformation processes from thermally activated overcoming of obstacles by dislocations in the quasi-static regime to the formation of adiabatic shear bands[33,34]. Specifically, the deformation at high strain rates of the material is highly concentrated which hinders the timely loss of the heat from plastic work. Once the contribution from thermal softening exceeds that from the strain hardening effect, the stress will decrease significantly, resulting in thermoplastic instability. It has been reported that the formation of adiabatic shear bands contribute to the self-sharpening effect which plays a critical role in improving penetration performance of ESMs[35].",['f0020'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Dynamic mechanical properties,"As discussed above, dynamic compressive deformation behavior is co-influenced by strain hardening, strain rate hardening and thermal softening, which is different from dislocation-slip-dominated quasi-static plastic deformation, we thus investigated the strain hardening rate (SHR),dσ/dε, vs. engineering plastic strain of the alloy at different strain rates. As is shown in Fig. 8 , during dynamic deformation at different strain rates, SHR firstly undergoes a steep fall in the non-linear elastic phase and then a small rise and fall in the yielding phase. It is also discovered that SHR under quasi-static regime is higher than those at the strain rate of 1270s−1and 1500s−1and nearly the same with that at the strain rate of 2200s−1, which is ascribed to severe thermal softening effect in the alloy. Though due to strain rate strengthening SHR is higher with higher strain rate, the thermal softening effect outweighs the strain rate strengthening effect in the alloy. Similar findings are reported in HfZrTiTaNb HEA[19]as well. However, as for AlCrCuFeNi2HEA[20], SHR at dynamic regime is higher than that of quasi-static regime, which is likely resulted from its much higher thermal conductivity compared to HfZrTiTa0.53. Since the lower for thermal conductivity the more difficult for heat resulted from large plastic work to release, thermal softening effect is more severe and adiabatic shear bands are easier to form with lower thermal conductivity. Without formation of adiabatic shear bands at high strain rates, Al0.3CrFeCoNi HEA[36]indeed possesses good resistance to shear failure while HfZrTiTa0.53HEA displays the adiabatic shear bands-dominated deformation mechanism.",['f0040'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Dynamic mechanical properties,"According to the criterion proposed by Grady[37], adiabatic shear dissipation energy (ASDE) is applied to evaluate adiabatic shear sensitivity. Specifically, the formation and expansion of adiabatic shear bands need to overcome an energy barrier. And the higher for the barrier, the harder for the formation of ASBs. The value of ASDE can be calculated in Eq.4:(4)Γ=ρcα9ρ3c2χ3σy3α2γ̇1/4whereГrepresents ASDE,ρis the material's density,cis the specific heat capacity of material,χ=λ/ρcand is the thermal diffusivity which reflects the heat dissipation ability (λrepresents the thermal conductivity),αis the thermal softening coefficient,γ̇is strain rate,σyis the yield stress atγ̇. Though it is difficult to experimentally obtain accurate data ofc,λandα, one can qualitatively evaluate adiabatic shear sensitivity. Thus the lower for thermal conductivity and the higher for yield stress, the more sensitive for the formation of ASBs. The thermal conductivity of pure metals used above are thus listed in Table 4 and it is explicitly that thermal conductivity of each component in AlCrCuFeNi2and Al0.3CrFeCoNi HEA is higher than that in HfZrTiTa0.53and HfZrTiTaNb HEA. In addition, the dynamic yield strength of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy is nearly 3 times and 1.5 times more than that of Al0.3CrFeCoNi and AlCrCuFeNi2. Therefore, one can conclude that adiabatic shear sensitivity of HfZrTiTa0.53HEA is higher than that of AlCrCuFeNi2HEA, which renders the former severe thermal softening effect and higher adiabatic shear sensibility.",['fo0020'],['t0020']
3.4,Results and discussion.Energetic characteristics and ballistic performance study,"In SHPB experiments, bright light was clearly observed from reaction between air and the alloy when impacted at strain rate higher than 950s−1and melting of the alloy in Fig. 6 d also suggests abundant heat production in the deforming process. Thus, the energetic characteristics of the alloy under high-speed impact are further investigated through ballistic experiments. In this experiment, the projectiles made by HfZrTiTa0.53high-entropy alloy impact on armor chamber finally after perforating A3plate initially. The hitting speeds of projectiles on the target are measured to be 857 and 600m·s−1, and named as P1and P2respectively. The impact-induced deflagration process of projectiles is recorded by high-speed video. The images taken 0.17, 0.5, 0.83, 2.5 and 5.83ms after perforating at P1and P2are shown in Fig. 9 a and brespectively. As can be seen, only a small part of the projectile is initiated to deflagrate when perforating A3plate, whereas a larger part is initiated when impacting on the armor chamber. Dazzling lights, large cone-shape expansion region and long duration of flame suggest that fragments react violently with air, then release a large amount of energy. The higher impacting velocity is, the more releasing energy, the larger expansion area and the longer duration of flame (~200ms) will be. It thus can be concluded that higher impact speed brings about more severe fracture of the alloy and further leads to more violent reaction between the air and fragments, which causes more release of energy. Commonly used combustible oxidizing metals with high exothermic energy are listed in Table 5 along with their density and heat of reaction. According to the rule of mixture, the theoretical combustion energy of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy is calculated to be 8982J·g−1and 83,784J·cm−3. It is a high value considering the trade-off between mechanical properties and heat of reaction. However, it is worth mentioning that theoretical energy only suggests the potential to release abundant energy during the impacting process of the material, further investigations should be carried out in terms of the extent of breaking and oxidizing as well as other energy release characteristics, e.g. shock wave response. In spite of this, trace of melting around the bullet holes which are marked with a while dotted circle on A3steel plate ( Fig. 10 ) still indicate that a large amount of heat is released, leading to the sharp increase of temperature to at least ~1400°C (the melting point of A3steel).","['f0030', 'f0045', 'f0050']",['t0025']
3.4,Results and discussion.Energetic characteristics and ballistic performance study,"On the other hand, the bullet holes on the A3steel plate is a typical plug-type shear damage ( Fig. 10 ). The diameter of expanded holes at P1and P2are 12.5mm and 14.5mm which are only 1.25 and 1.45 times of the projectiles' diameter. It suggests that the projectile maintains its shape and keeps structural stability without cracking during perforating process which are derived from the good mechanical properties and adiabatic shear bands failure mechanism of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy at high strain rates. In short, the excellent mechanical properties of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy ensure the projectiles maintain its shape without severe cracking during penetrating process; while the energetic characteristics of the alloy lead to release of abundant energy upon high-speed impact. This outstanding performance in ballistic experiments adequately exhibits the great potential of HfZrTiTa0.53alloy to be novel high strength energetic structural materials.",['f0050'],[]
