0,Abstract,"In this paper, Co2MoxNi2VWx (x=0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, and 1.75 in molar ratio) eutectic high entropy alloys (EHEAs) were designed to achieve a combination of strength and ductility. The effects of Mo and W elements on the microstructures and mechanical properties of the alloys were investigated, and results showed that by decreasing the Mo and W contents to 0.8 in Co2MoxNi2VWx alloy, a fully eutectic microstructure was obtained. By increasing the Mo and W contents to 1.75, a primary BCC solid solution phase plus eutectic microstructure were obtained. The eutectic microstructure consisted of a mixture of FCC solid solution phase and μ phase. The Co2Mo0·8Ni2VW0.8 alloy with the largest volume fraction of eutectic microstructure exhibited the highest compression strength of 2364MPa, while the Co2Mo1·75Ni2VW1.75 alloy with the largest volume fraction of BCC phase exhibited the highest yield strength of 1607MPa.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Multi-principal element alloys or high entropy alloys (HEAs) possess an appealing combination of physical and mechanical properties, such as exceptional fracture toughness, high hardness, good wear and fatigue resistance, excellent soft magnetic properties, and remarkably high-temperature strength[1–13]. HEAs have great potential to be used as high-temperature structural materials in many fields.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Recently, many HEAs based on refractory elements, such as NbMoTaW, NbMoTaWV, TiZrHfNbTa, MoNbHfZrTi, and TiZrNbMoV have been designed and investigated[14–18]. These high-temperature HEAs show remarkably high temperature strength. For example, the yield strengths of WMoNbTaV and WMoNbTa refractory alloys are much higher than those of Haynes 230 and Inconel 718 at temperatures above 800°C[14]. However, the low ductility at room temperature and insufficient casting liquidity are concerns for commercial applications of these materials. It is known that eutectic alloys as in-situ formed composite materials have advantageous characteristics for high-temperature applications, such as excellent casting liquidity, high thermal stability, low-energy phase boundaries, high rupture strength, and good high-temperature creep resistance. Furthermore, a good combination of high strength and high ductility can be achieved by appropriately designing a dual-phase eutectic microstructure. Based on this thinking, the design concept of EHEAs was proposed and investigated to develop potential high-temperature structural materials[19]. To date, many EHEAs have been found and investigated[19–28]. Unfortunately, locating the eutectic alloy composition in HEAs is quite difficult due to the complexity in calculating the phase diagrams for multi-principal-element alloys. Nevertheless, designing EHEAs could get help by referencing existing binary phase diagrams and experimental results reported in the literature. For example, Co, Ni, Mo, and V elements with high melting points are often added into HEAs to form eutectic microstructures. W and Mo elements often form eutectic structures with Co and Ni elements, and the addition of W element can enhance the strength of alloys[29–32]. A combination of the above mentioned methods (binary phase diagrams and existing experimental results), theoretical models, and empirical or semi-empirical parameters, such as atomic-size difference (δ), mixing entropy (ΔSmix), valence electron concentration (VEC), electro-negativity difference (Δχ), and mixing enthalpyΔHmix,ΩΩ=TmΔSmixΔHmix,γγ=ωSωL, in which ωSand ωLare the solid angles of the smallest and largest atomic sizes, respectively, is then used by the current authors to design Co2MoxNi2VWxalloys that are reported here[33–38]. All elements of Co2MoxNi2VWxalloys are high-temperature elements, and therefore the alloys have the potential to be applied in high-temperature environments, such as thermal power plants, gas turbines, and the aerospace industry. This work investigated the effects of Mo and W elements on the microstructure and mechanical properties of HEAs.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Alloy ingots with nominal compositions of Co2MoxNi2VWx(x values in molar ratio, x=0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.5, and 1.75, and the alloys were denoted by A0.5, A0.6, A0.8, A1.0, A1.5 and A1.75, correspondingly) were prepared by arc melting in a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere. The ingots were re-melted at least 5 times to improve their chemical homogeneity. The dimensions of the solidified ingots were about 30mm in diameter and 15mm in length and weighed approximately 35g. The crystalline structures of the samples were identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using an EMPYREAN diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation operating at 40kV/40mA and a scanning step of 0.033° from 2θ=20° to 100°. Cylindrical samples of Φ 5×10mm were cut from the ingots, and compressive tests were carried out using a testing machine (WPM) with a strain rate of 1×10−3/s. The fractured surfaces and morphology of the alloys were examined using the scanning electron microscopy (SEM, Zeiss supra 55) equipped with the energy-dispersive spectrometer (EDS).",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Crystal structures,"XRD patterns of the Co2MoxNi2VWxalloys are shown in Fig. 1 . As can be seen, the A0.5, A0.6, and A0.8 alloys were composed of a FCC solid solution phase and a μ phase. The structure of the μ phase was close to the Co7Mo6phase. Similar structures have also been found and investigated in Ni-based super-alloys[39–41]. With the increase of Mo and W contents from x=0.5 to x=0.8, more reflection peaks corresponding to the μ phase were clearly observed. However, the reflection peaks corresponding to the μ phase decreased with further increasing of Mo and W contents (x≥1.0). Meanwhile, reflection peaks of the BCC solid solution phase appeared, and the intensity of the BCC diffraction peaks increased with increasing Mo and W contents.",['f0005'],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Crystal structures,"To date, a number of theoretical models and empirical or semi-empirical parameters have been proposed to predict the phase formation and phase stability of HEAs. For example, Zhang and Yang et al. used the parameters of ΔHmix, ΔSmix, δ and Ω to delineate the phase formation in HEAs[33,34]; Wang, et al. presented a new parameter, γ, to distinguish the formation of solid solutions from that of multiphase alloys containing intermetallics[35]. It was suggested that γ<1.175 is a necessary condition to form solid solutions in HEAs; Guo et al. used another parameter, VEC, to predict the crystalline structure of solid solutions in HEAs[36]; Liu et al.[37]used the δ-VEC criterion to separate the formation of solid-solution phases and intermetallic compounds. They concluded that the simple solid-solution phase only form at δ<4.6%, whereas intermetallic compounds or ordered phases tend to form at δ>4.6%. Under the condition of δ>4.6%, FCC solid-solution phase mainly form with some intermetallic compounds at VEC>7.8, while BCC solid-solution phases mainly form with some intermetallic compounds at VEC<6.7; Dong et al. used the parameter Δχ to predict the stability of the topologically close-packed (TCP) phase in HEAs[38]. The values of ΔHmix, ΔSmix, δ, Ω, γ, VEC, and Δχ for current HEAs are listed in Table 1 . The calculation formulas for ΔHmix, ΔSmix, δ, Ω, γ, VEC, and Δχ can be obtained from Ref[33–37]. As shown in Table 1 , δ of all alloys (except A0.5 with δ=4.554%) are higher than 4.6%. Under this circumstance, VEC of the Co2MoxNi2VWxalloys decreases from 8.17 for A0.5 to 7.97 for A0.8. A0.5, A0.6 and A0.8 alloys exhibit a main FCC solid-solution phase and a μ phase. This is in agreement with Liu's predictions[37]. Moreover, the μ phase appeared in all alloys with Δχ>0.133, which agrees with Dong's prediction[38]. The structures of HEAs are very complex, and these parameters should all be considered in a comprehensive manner.",[],"['t0005', 't0005']"
3.2,Results and discussion.Microstructures,"SEM images of the Co2MoxNi2VWxalloys are shown in Figs. 2  and 3. The A0.5 and A0.6 alloys exhibited a typical near-eutectic microstructure, where the eutectic phase showed a lamellar morphology, as given in Fig. 2(b)  and (d). A fully eutectic microstructure was obtained for the A0.8 alloy (see Fig. 2(e)  and (f)). With the increase of Mo and W contents (x<1.0), the eutectic microstructure was gradually refined, and the smallest lamellar spacing ~0.4–0.6μm was obtained when x=0.8. Interestingly, with further increasing of Mo and W contents (x≥1.0), the microstructure changed to a primary BCC phase plus secondary phase + eutectic microstructure for the A1.0 and A1.5 alloys, and finally to a primary phase plus eutectic microstructure for the A1.75 alloy with a lamellar spacing of about 0.5μm.","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0015']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Microstructures,"In Figs. 2  and 3, regions E1 and E2 represent the eutectic phase, region A1 represents the primary phase, region A2 represents the secondary phase, and region B represents the primary phase in the Co2MoxNi2VWxalloys. Compositions of different regions of the alloys are listed in Table 2 , where it can be seen that the compositional distributions in the A1 and E1 regions were similar to those in the A2 and E2 regions. The A1.0 alloy had three distinct regions (A2, E2, and B). EDS mapping of the A1.0 alloy is shown in Fig. 4 to compare the composition of the different regions. As can be seen from Table 2 and Fig. 4 , region B was a W-rich phase (the concentration of the W>50at.%). Regions A1 and A2 were depleted in W and Mo elements while regions E1 and E2 were enriched with Mo and W elements. However, the E1 region was more enriched with W element and the E2 region was more enriched with Mo element. This could be due to the W-rich phase nucleated from the melt, resulting in a remnant liquid with more Mo content than W content when x≥1.0. Furthermore, the Mo concentration in the E2 region obviously increased with the addition of W and Mo elements.","['f0020', 'f0020', 'f0010', 'f0015']","['t0010', 't0010']"
3.2,Results and discussion.Microstructures,"Combined with the EDS and XRD results, a conclusion can be drawn that the A1 and A2 regions corresponded to the FCC solid solution phase, the E1 and E2 regions were composed of a mixture of a FCC solid solution phase and a Co7Mo6-type μ phase, and the B region corresponded to the BCC solid solution phase. In other words, it could be seen that the microstructure of the Co2Ni2VMoxWxalloys changed from a hypoeutectic microstructure (0.5≤x<0.8) to a fully eutectic microstructure (x=0.8), and then to a primary W-rich BCC solid solution phase plus secondary FCC solid solution phase + eutectic microstructure (1.0≤x≤1.5). Finally, it changed to a primary W-rich BCC solid solution phase plus eutectic microstructure (x=1.75), which consisted of a FCC solid solution phase and a Co7Mo6-type μ phase.",[],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Microstructures,"Based on the Co-Mo and Co-W binary phase diagrams, the process of the microstructure evolution can be clearly understood[42,43]. According to these phase diagrams, the following information was revealed: (1) The solubility limit of W/Mo in Co solid solution are 17.5at.% and 20at.%, respectively; (2) The eutectic reaction L↔μ+(αCo) occurred at 20–30at.%W/Mo; and (3) With increasing W/Mo contents, a W/Mo solid solution phase was formed. Combined with the as-solidified microstructure, it was deduced that the eutectic reaction occurred in the A0.5 alloy. Specifically, the FCC dendrite phase first nucleated from the melt, and the remnant liquid formed a eutectic microstructure. With the addition of Mo and W elements, the alloy composition was moving closer to the eutectic point. Accordingly, the volume fraction of the eutectic structures increased till x=0.8, when a fully eutectic reaction occurred. With Mo and W contents increased to x=1.0, the W-rich BCC solid solution phase nucleated and grew from the melt, then, the A2 phase nucleated and grew from the melt following the W-rich BCC solid solution phase. Later, the eutectic reaction occurred in the residual liquids to form the E2 eutectic microstructure. With further increasing of Mo and W contents, the A2 phase disappeared and the whole microstructure was constituted by the W-rich primary phase plus eutectic microstructure, which appeared in A1.75. To better illustrate the solidification sequence of the Co2MoxNi2VWxalloys, a schematic plot is provided in Fig. 5 .",['f0025'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties," Fig. 6(a) gives the Vickers hardness of the Co2MoxNi2VWxalloys. The hardness of the alloys increased obviously from x=0.5 to x=0.8 and then decreased slightly at x=1.0. It increased again till x=1.75. The maximum hardness of 667HV was obtained in the A1.75 alloy. The increase of hardness from x=0.5 to x=0.8 was attributed to the increased volume fraction of the eutectic microstructure. With further increases of Mo and W contents to x=1.0, a decreased volume fraction of eutectic microstructure led to a slightly lower hardness. The increase of hardness from x=1.0 to x=1.75 was attributed to the increased volume fraction of the hard BCC phase and eutectic microstructure.",['f0030'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"Compressive stress-strain curves are shown in Fig. 6(b)  for the Co2MoxNi2VWxalloys, and their indicative properties are listed in Table 3 . As can be seen, the A0.5 alloy exhibited excellent compressive ductility (εp>50%) and yield strength (925MPa). The high ductility was attributed to the high volume fraction of the soft FCC phase. Increasing the Mo and W contents improved the strength of the alloys significantly but decreased the ductility. The A0.8 alloy showed a maximum compressive strength of 2364MPa, a high yield strength of 1431MPa, and a large compressive plastic strain of 14.4%. The highest compressive strength achieved in A0.8 alloy was attributed to the fully eutectic microstructure. Meanwhile, the A1.75 alloy exhibited the highest yield strength of 1607MPa, the second highest compressive strength of 2313MPa, and a compressive plastic strain of 9.4%. Plastic strain dropped substantially due to the microstructural change and the increased volume fraction of the hard BCC phase.",['f0030'],['t0015']
3.3,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties," Fig. 7 displays the fracture morphologies of the Co2MoxNi2VWxalloys. The A0.6 alloy showed characteristics of cleavage fracture, and the high-density cleavage steps are shown in Fig. 7(a) . The fracture surfaces of the A0.8, A1.0, and A1.5 alloys showed cleavage steps and torn edges, which indicated that the fracture mode was cleavage/quasi-cleavage fracture, as shown in Fig. 7(b) -(d). For the A1.75 alloy, the flat fracture surface and obvious crack (marked with arrows) indicated that the alloy had a rather limited plastic strain during the compression process, as shown in Fig. 7(e) . This observation agreed with the compressive test results shown in Fig. 6(b) .","['f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0030']",[]
