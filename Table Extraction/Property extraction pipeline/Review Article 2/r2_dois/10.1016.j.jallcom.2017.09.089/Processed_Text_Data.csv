0,Abstract,"The dual-phase AlCoCrFeNi alloy exhibits excellent specific strength in the 773–873 K temperature range. However, the phase transformation taking place above 773 K hinders its structural use at higher temperatures. In the present study, the temperature dependence of the specific strength of the AlCoCrFeNi alloy has been examined from a microstructural point of view. One of the key findings of this work is that the high-temperature phase stability of the dual-phase alloy is strongly affected by its microstructural morphology; this finding provides new insights into the application of high-entropy alloys as high-temperature structural materials, for instance in aerospace engine components.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The untapped potential of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has attracted considerable interest in recent years. HEAs offer a new route to form highly stable and simpler solid solution structures (as compared to intermetallic compounds) in multicomponent alloys composed of more than five main elements, each ranging from 5 to 35 at.%[1–3]. These systems exhibit several remarkable features, such as high entropy, severe lattice distortion, sluggish diffusion, and cocktail effects[1,2]. Some previous studies[4–8]have highlighted the considerable potential of high-entropy alloys in applications involving extreme conditions. Gludovatz et al.[7]reported that the CrMnFeCoNi alloy exhibits excellent mechanical properties at cryogenic temperatures. In contrast, Senkov et al.[8]showed that refractory HEAs such as NbMoTaW and VNbMoTaW exhibit good single-phase stability and consistent mechanical properties over the temperature range of 873–1273 K. In both cases, the unique properties of the alloys have been attributed to the formation of a single-phase solid solution with high configurational entropy (≥1.6R, whereRis the gas constant). However, when more than five elements are present, the number of possible combinations capable of forming a single-phase solid solution is very limited[9,10]and needs to be expanded. Dual-phase HEAs (DP-HEAs) are a new category of HEAs that represent good candidates in this context.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Dual-phase structures commonly offer superior strength at high temperatures, particularly when the two phases have a high degree of coherence[11–14]. In the case of Ni-based superalloys, composed mainly ofγ(disordered fcc A1 structure) andγ′ (ordered fccL12structure), theγ′ phase plays a key role in increasing the high-temperature strength, as precipitation and solid solution strengthening at high temperatures represent important strengthening mechanisms[15–18]. According to some previous reports[19–22], the AlCoCrFeNi alloy also exhibits a dual-phase structure composed of disordered (A2) and ordered (B2) bcc phases at fast solidification rates, and there is a high degree of coherence between the two phases. Based on its microstructural morphology, we can expect that the AlCoCrFeNi alloy shows superior strength at high temperatures. In addition, the AlCoCrFeNi alloy is lighter and cheaper to fabricate than conventional superalloys, owing to its high Al and Fe contents. The AlCoCrFeNi alloy can thus be regarded as a lightweight DP-HEA superalloy. However, the high-temperature properties of this alloy have not yet been investigated in detail. Therefore, in the present study, we assess the high-temperature behavior of the AlCoCrFeNi alloy, focusing in particular on its specific yield strength.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"Master alloy buttons (10 g) with a nominal composition of Al20Co20Cr20Fe20Ni20(at.%) were prepared by arc-melting the high-purity (>99.9 at.%) constituent metals under an argon atmosphere. Each alloy button was remelted more than five times to obtain a homogeneous composition. Cylindrical samples with a diameter of 5 mm and height of 50 mm were fabricated by suction casting. Phase transformations were examined using X-ray diffraction (XRD, Rigaku D/Max 2500). A series of uniaxial compression tests were performed at target temperatures ranging from 300 to 1173 K with a strain rate of 1 × 10−3s−1, using an electromechanical universal testing machine equipped with a halogen heater capable of fast heating rates above 100 K/s. For the compression tests, cylindrical specimens with a diameter of 3 mm and height of 6 mm were prepared by suction casting.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"The microstructural features of the samples were characterized by field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL JSM-7001F) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM, FEI Talos F200X) equipped with Super-X energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system. Nanoscale chemical analyses of the constituent phases were carried out using three-dimensional atom probe tomography (3D-APT, CAMECA LEAP 4000X HR). The specimens for TEM and 3D-APT analyses were prepared using focused ion beam milling equipment (FIB, FEI Helios 600). To examine the microstructural evolution at high temperatures, high-resolution electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) with a step size of 20 nm was conducted by a FE-SEM (TESCAN CZ/MIRA I LMH) device equipped with an EBSD detector. The EBSD data were analyzed using the Orientation Imaging Microscopy 7.0 (Edax Inc.) software.",[],[]
3,Results and discussion,"A cross-sectional SEM image of the as-cast AlCoCrFeNi alloy is shown inFig. 1a, whereasFig. 1b and c show the HAADF scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) images and EDS elemental maps for Al, Ni, Co, Cr, and Fe in dendritic and interdendritic regions, respectively. The A2 + B2 dual-phase structure of the alloy was confirmed by the selected area diffraction pattern shown inFig. 1d. As shown inFig. 1b and c, dendritic and interdendritic regions have a different microstructural morphology, as a result of solute segregation during dendritic solidification. Previous studies[20,22]have reported that Cr and Fe segregate into the liquid phase during dendritic solidification in the AlCoCrFeNi alloy. However, despite the solute segregation, the constituent phases (Al-Ni-rich B2 and Cr-Fe-rich A2) of the dendritic and interdendritic regions are the same. Interestingly, the results of the 3D-APT analysis of these regions indicate that each phase maintains essentially the same chemical composition, independent of its location, which reflects the different volume fraction of the B2 phase (VB2) in the dendritic and interdendritic regions (seeFig. 1b and c). In particular, the chemical compositions of the B2 and A2 phases are Al30.3Co20.2Cr5.2Fe13.9Ni30.4and Al1.4Co21.5Cr42.0Fe30.5Ni4.6(at.%), respectively. These compositions are assumed to reflect the tendency to minimize the lattice mismatch between the two phases. The selected area electron diffraction patterns inFig. 1d give a lattice constant of 0.292 nm for both phases. In particular,VB2is higher in the dendrite than in the interdendrite fraction, as the former has higher contents of Al and Ni and lower contents of Cr and Fe than the latter.","['fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1']",[]
3,Results and discussion,"The temperature dependences of the specific yield strength of different bcc HEAs and the specific strength of various types of high-temperature structural alloys[8,23,24]are compared inFig. 2. As shown in the figure, bcc HEAs generally show superior specific yield strength at high temperatures compared to conventional alloys. The alloy VNbMoTaW, a well-known refractory single-phase bcc HEA, shows higher specific yield strength than superalloys such as Inconel 718 and Haynes 230 in the 873–1473 K temperature range[8]. The specific yield strength of Al-containing refractory bcc HEAs such as AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr and AlNb1.5Ta0.5Ti1.5Zr0.5[24]is even higher than that of VNbMoTaW, owing to their high content of light elements such as aluminum. In particular, the superior high-temperature specific strength of AlMo0.5NbTa0.5TiZr is derived from its dual-phase structure[24]. However, the low room-temperature ductility of refractory HEAs limits their structural applications. On the other hand, compared to these alloys, the AlCoCrFeNi alloy possesses a much higher ductility at room temperature[21,22]. In addition, it shows superior specific strength compared to TiAl and titanium alloys in the temperature range from 773 to 873 K. The high-temperature compressive mechanical properties of the AlCoCrFeNi alloy are shown inTable 1. The temperature dependence of the specific strength of the AlCoCrFeNi alloy was thus investigated in more detail, by comparing it with that of the high-temperature titanium alloy, IMI 834[25].",['fig2'],['tbl1']
3,Results and discussion,"Fig. 3a shows that the specific yield strength of IMI 834 decreases almost linearly with increasing temperature. However, while at room temperature the specific yield strength of AlCoCrFeNi is similar to that of IMI 834, it does not show a similar decrease between room temperature and 773 K. Interestingly, this effect is similar to the so-called yield strength anomaly, which is often observed in precipitation-hardened superalloys[14,26–28]. For these alloys, the yield strength exhibits little variation between room temperature and temperatures up to several hundred degrees Celsius. This is because the formation of antiphase boundaries within ordered intermetallics such asL12leads to significant strengthening of the alloys[26,27]. Feuerbacher[29]suggested that the high strength of AlCoCrFeNi is because of its high antiphase boundary energy, which suppresses the movement of superdislocations within the B2 matrix. Therefore, the superior high-temperature strength of AlCoCrFeNi can be ascribed to the formation of antiphase boundaries within the B2 matrix. However, before analyzing in detail the high-temperature deformation mechanisms, the phase stability of the AlCoCrFeNi alloy at high temperatures should be discussed. The specific yield strength of the AlCoCrFeNi alloy exhibits a sharp drop above 773 K (seeFig. 3a). Therefore, we investigated the phase stability above 773 K to verify whether the sharp change in the specific yield strength can be attributed to a phase transformation.Fig. 3b shows the XRD patterns of the as-cast AlCoCrFeNi and of samples heat-treated at 773, 873, and 973 K for 6 h. A phase transformation from bcc to fcc and sigma (σ) phases can be observed between 773 and 973 K. This result thus confirms that the sharp drop in the specific yield strength above 773 K is related to the solid-solid phase transformation, which may limit the maximum operating temperature of the AlCoCrFeNi alloy.Fig. 4a and b show the EBSD image quality and phase maps of the AlCoCrFeNi sample heat-treated at 973 K for 6 h, respectively. Despite the prolonged heat treatment at 973 K, dendrites and interdendrites exhibit considerably different microstructural features: the interdendritic regions consist of bcc (green), fcc (red), andσ(yellow) phases, while the dendritic ones are still mainly composed of the bcc phase (seeFig. 4b). The magnified SEM image (Fig. 4c) corresponding to the region marked by the dotted line inFig. 4b clearly highlights the different microstructural morphology of dendritic and interdendritic regions. The dendritic region seems to have coarsened A2 + B2 dual-phase structure, implying that isolated structures (seeFig. 1b, where cubic A2 particles are embedded in the B2 matrix) are more effective at slowing down the phase transformation than interconnected structures (seeFig. 1c). This is probably because the average size of the cuboidal A2 particles (∼150 nm) is still much smaller than the critical nucleus size for heterogeneous nucleation for precipitation ofσor fcc phase, since these phases form directly from A2 phase[19]. These results suggest that differences in the initial microstructural morphology can strongly affect the high-temperature phase stability of the AlCoCrFeNi alloy.","['fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig1', 'fig1']",[]
4,Conclusions,"In conclusion, the dual-phase AlCoCrFeNi alloy showed considerable potential for high-temperature structural applications such as aerospace engine components, owing to its lightweight characteristics and superior specific strength at intermediate/high temperatures compared to commercial alloys. However, the solid-solid phase transformation taking place above 773 K limits the long-term use of the alloy at high temperatures. The difference in microstructural evolution between dendritic and interdendritic regions reveals that the initial microstructural morphology is one of the key factors determining the high-temperature phase stability of the alloy. The present study indicates that a fully isolated dual-phase structure can increase the maximum operating temperature of the DP-HEAs by enhancing the high-temperature phase stability of the alloys without sacrificing their specific yield strength. Based on these results, we propose that tailoring the microstructural morphology through alloy design and heat treatment can represent an effective way to exploit the potential of the dual-phase high-entropy alloys as high-temperature structural materials.",[],[]
