fig3,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2017.09.089/figures/gr3.jpg,Fig. 3,"(a) Comparison of specific yield strength of AlCoCrFeNi and IMI 834[25]alloys at high temperatures. (b) X-ray diffraction patterns of as-cast AlCoCrFeNi and of AlCoCrFeNi samples heat-treated at 773, 873, and 973 K for 6 h."
fig4,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2017.09.089/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,"(a) EBSD image quality map and (b) phase map of the AlCoCrFeNi sample heat-treated at 973 K for 6 h. Green, red, and yellow colors in the phase map indicate bcc, fcc, andσphases, respectively. (c) Magnified SEM image of the region marked by the dotted line in panel (b), showing the different microstructural morphology of dendritic and interdendritic regions.
