fig1,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2015.11.050/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,"SEM micrographs (BSE, orientation and composition contrast) of the microstructure of Nb-Mo-Cr-Ti-Al in the: a) as-cast and annealed conditions after heat treatment at b) 1100 °C, c) 1200 °C and d) 1300 °C for 20 h, respectively. All major micrographs are taken at the same magnification. Inset magnification is specified, respectively. The inset in (b) highlights the morphology of the at least three different phases at higher magnification. The insets in (c) and (d) show secondary phases with continuous as well as acicular morphology at the grain boundaries."
fig2,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2015.11.050/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,"Background subtracted XRD patterns of cross sections of Nb-Mo-Cr-Ti-Al in different conditions: a) full pattern and b) section of the pattern with logarithmic intensity scale. Bragg positions of bcc structures with varying lattice parameters (provided in nm) are indicated by dashed lines in (a). Bragg positions of the hexagonal Laves phase are highlighted according to the labels in (b) – positions with little intensity were excluded. Intensities may be influenced by limited number of grain orientations within the samples. The lines, indicating the lattice constant variation, are extended to the diffraction patterns of the annealed state in order to ease comparison."
fig3,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2015.11.050/figures/gr3.jpg,Fig. 3,"EBSD patterns with corresponding zone axes of Nb-Mo-Cr-Ti-Al taken at 20 kV on samples in different conditions (a complete set of patterns for all phases is included in the online supplementary). The Laves phase is the hexagonal modification of Cr2Nb (MgZn2prototype, Strukturbericht designation C14)."
fig4,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2015.11.050/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,"Stress-strain dependence of quasistatic compression tests at: a) room temperature, 400 °C and 600 °C as well as b) 800 °C, 1000 °C and 1200 °C. Fracture is highlighted by X. Arrows indicate tests deliberately stopped."
fig5,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2015.11.050/figures/gr5.jpg,Fig. 5,"Orientation imaging microscopy on longitudinal sections of Nb-Mo-Cr-Ti-Al quasistatically deformed in compression: a) initial condition and deformed at b) 400 °C, c) 800 °C, d) 1000 °C and e) 1200 °C. Compression direction is vertical and the color code corresponds to the inverse pole figure of the compression direction (inset in (b)). The maps are of the same size and observed using a step size of 5 μm."
fig6,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2015.11.050/figures/gr6.jpg,Fig. 6,"Detailed SEM micrographs (BSE, orientation and composition contrast) of Nb-Mo-Cr-Ti-Al subsequent to deformation at: a) 800 °C, b) 1000 °C, and c) 1200 °C. All SEM micrographs are taken at the same magnification."
fig7,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2015.11.050/figures/gr7.jpg,Fig. 7,EBSD patterns with corresponding zone axes of Nb-Mo-Cr-Ti-Al taken at 20 kV. A complete set of patterns for all phases is included in the online supplementary.
fig8,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2015.11.050/figures/gr8.jpg,Fig. 8,"Orientation distribution as contours in the inverse pole figures of the compression direction of Nb-Mo-Cr-Ti-Al quasistatically deformed in compression: a) initial condition, deformed at b) 400 °C, c) 800 °C, d) 1000 °C, and e) 1200 °C. Scale in multiples of the random distribution (inset in (a)) is kept constant."
fig9,articles_test/10.1016.j.jallcom.2015.11.050/figures/gr9.jpg,Fig. 9,"a) Maximum Schmid factors (active slip system under single slip) of the pencil slip systems with common11¯1slip direction and {110}, {121}, and {132} slip planes presented in the inverse pole figure of the compression direction. b) Rotation of the compression direction, indicated by arrows, in dependence of the initial orientation of a single crystal. Under compression load, the compression direction tends to rotate towards to slip plane normal. Dashed lines indicate the connection of slip plane normals when multiple slip is preferred."
