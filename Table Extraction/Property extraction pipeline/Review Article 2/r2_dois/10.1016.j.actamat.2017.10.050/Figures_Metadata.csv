fig4,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.10.050/figures/egi107M55ZSH2K.jpg,Fig. 4,Two-beam BF-STEM images of dislocations in the deformed alloy. (a) Deformation dislocations imaged at a 111-type diffraction operation. (b) The changes of dislocation core widths of the dissociated dislocations with dislocation character angles along the curved dislocation line.

The partial dislocations are denoted by P.
