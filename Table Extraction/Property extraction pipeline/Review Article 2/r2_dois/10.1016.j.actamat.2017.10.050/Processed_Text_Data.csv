0,Abstract,"Structural characterization of dislocations and dislocation reactions in a face-centered cubic high entropy alloy was conducted using the state-of-the-art spherical aberration corrected transmission electron microscopy. We experimentally measured the stacking fault energy of the high entropy alloy from the atomic images and diffraction contrast of dislocation cores. The low stacking fault energy results in widely dissociated dislocations and extensive dislocation reactions, which leads to the formation of immobile Lomer and Lomer-Cottrell dislocation locks. These dislocation locks act as both dislocation barriers and sources and are responsible for the significant work hardening with a large hardening rate in the alloy. Based on the atomic-scale characterization and classical dislocation theory, a simple equation was derived to describe the work hardening behavior of the high entropy alloy in the early-stage of plastic deformation.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Recently developed high entropy alloys (HEAs) have exhibited many sought-after mechanical properties, such as superior fracture toughness at cryogenic temperatures[1], high work hardening rates[2], and high phase stability[3], which traditional metallic materials usually do not offer. The mechanical properties of HEAs, similar to those in the conventional metals and alloys, strongly depend on the microstructure and, particularly, the structure of dislocations and dislocation interactions, which shed insights of plastic deformation, work hardening, ductility and fracture toughness[4–8]. However, the dislocation structure in HEAs, in particular, at the atomic scale, has only been sporadically studied[2,6–10]and the underlying micromechanisms for the mechanical properties of HEAs, such as high ductility and work hardening rates[3,10], still remain largely uncertain. For example, the reported Al0.1CoCrFeNi HEA shows significant work hardening at a low strain rate of ∼10−3/s and room temperatures. The high degree of work hardening at an early-stage of deformation (8% plastic strain with 1060 MPa stress at strain rate of 1.0 × 10−3/s) is comparable with commercial FCC-base alloys, for example, 1435 MPa at 4.8 × 10−3/s for SS304 and 1084 MPa at 1.0 × 10−3/s for Inconel 718, which are known to have a high work hardening rate. However, these commercial alloys have multiple phases which certainly enhance the work hardening[11–13]. The high work hardening capacity in the single phase FCC Al0.1CoCrFeNi HEA is probably caused by not only the high intrinsic strengthening of HEAs as a result of the lattice distortion (or dilation)[14], but also a low stacking fault energy (SFE) due to the multicomponent nature of the FCC base HEA. However, microscopic mechanisms and the role of low SFE on the mechanical properties of the HEA have not been well understood. In this study, we employed the state-of-the-art aberration corrected (Cs-corrected) TEM with a high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) detector to examine the dislocation structure and dislocation reactions in a deformed single-phase face-centered-cubic (FCC) Al0.1CoCrFeNi HEA in an attempt to address the microscopic mechanisms of the mechanical properties.",[],[]
2.1,Experimental procedures.Alloy preparation and mechanical testing,"The alloy with a nominal composition of Al0.1CoCrFeNi (in molar proportion, Al is 0.1 part of the rest constituent elements and therefore 2.5% in atomic percent) was prepared by vacuum induction casting with 99.9% purity constituent elements. The cast ingots were subjected to a hot isostatic pressure (HIP) treatment at 1200 °C and 100 MPa. After 4 h of HIP treatment, the ingots were continuously cooled to 340 °C for 3 h, and then cooled to 190 °C for 1 h before removing them from the pressure chamber to atmosphere. To investigate the deformation behavior of the alloy, tensile samples with the gauge diameter of 3.15 mm and gauge length of 31.5 mm were tested at room temperature at a nominal strain rate of ∼1 × 10−4/s. An extensometer clipping at both ends of the gauge was used for precise strain measurements. The tensile tests were purposely stopped at a strain of about 8% to achieve a dislocation density that is appropriate for TEM analysis. At this strain, sufficient deformation dislocations and dislocation reactions are produced and, meanwhile, the dislocation density is not too high to prevent the atomic scale characterization of individual dislocations and precise measurements of dislocation core widths.",[],[]
2.2,Experimental procedures.Microstructure characterization,"The grain morphology of the alloy was characterized by a field-emission scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with an electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) detector and an energy dispersive X-ray spectrometer. The crystal structure and lattice parameter of the alloy were measured by X-ray diffraction (XRD) at room temperatures with a scanning rate of 0.01 °per step. Sharp tip specimens for atom probe tomography (APT) were made by electrochemical micro-polishing and followed by focused ion beam milling (JIB-4601F, JEOL). The finished tip profiles were examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for APT reconstruction. The data acquisition was performed by using a local electrode atom probe (LEAP 4000HR) equipped with an energy-compensated reflectron by which the mass resolution can be greatly improved. The APT acquisition temperature was set at∼50 K and the pulse frequency and pulse fractions were 200 kHz and 20%, respectively. The CAMECA Integrated Visualization and Analysis Software (IVAS 3.6.8) package was used for the data process and three-dimensional (3D) atomic reconstruction.",[],[]
2.3,Experimental procedures.TEM characterization,"Thin foils for TEM and STEM observations were prepared using a twin jet electrochemical polisher with a 10 vol % nitric acid and 90% methanol and the electrolyte was cooled by liquid nitrogen before polishing. The (S)TEM observations were performed using a 200 kV JEOL JEM-2100F and ARM-200F electron microscopes equipped with spherical aberration correctors for both the probe forming and image forming lenses. Bright field and high angle annular dark field images were acquired using a Gatan BF detector and an annular-type HAADF detector with an angle ranging from 100 to 267 mrad. Low-magnificationg/3gweak beam dark field (WBDF) TEM images were also acquired by a conventional Phillips CM12 microscope with an operation voltage of 120 kV. The dislocation densities in the as-prepared and deformed samples were estimated on the basis of TEM and STEM micrographs. Since the dislocation density is usually defined as the total length of dislocations per unit volume or, conversely, the number of dislocation lines intersecting a unit area, it can thus be estimated by measuring the number of dislocations in each unit area. The core widths of dissociated dislocations were measured by high resolution TEM, HAADF-STEM and BF-STEM with a two-beam condition under a 220-type diffraction vector operation for dislocations in the <011>{111} and <111>{111} zones. The dissociated dislocations in relatively thick regions were chosen for the core width measurements to minimize the possible interference from sample surfaces. The lengths of Burgers vectors are determined from HRTEM (or STEM) images using Burgers loops. In a similar manner, the Burgers vectors of the dissociated partial dislocations were determined by using Thompson's Tetrahedron notation and measurements of Burgers magnitude from HRTEM/HRSTEM images.",[],[]
3,Results and discussions,"Figure 1a shows the polycrystalline microstructure of a Al0.1CoCrFeNi HEA after a HIP treatment at 1200 °C and 100 MPa for 4 h. The coarsened grains by high temperature annealing have a size as larger as about millimeters. All the diffraction peaks in the X-ray diffraction spectrum (Fig. 1b) can be indexed as a FCC crystal with a lattice constant of 3.535 Å. The single phase nature is consistent with the analyses by selected area electron diffraction (SAED) (Fig. 1c) from which only a simple FCC phase can be seen from the <200> SAED pattern. The convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern taken from a nano-regime along a <111> direction (Fig. 1d) only shows a near perfect FCC6 mmsymmetry. The obvious symmetry breaking by lattice distortions and local chemical ordering cannot be seen. The nominal and experimentally measured compositions by atom probe tomography (APT) are listed inTable 1. The elemental distributions are uniform down to the sub-nano-scale as shown in the APT mappings (Fig. 2a). Quantitative measurements of the concentration profiles of each element from a cubiod region further confirm the chemical homogeneity (Fig. 2b). To investigate possible local chemical ordering, we conducted the frequency distribution analysis of the atom probe dataset (Fig. 2c) from which the visible chemical segregation cannot be detected by APT. The chemical homogeneity of the alloy is also confirmed by Cs-corrected scanning TEM (STEM) with an atomic-scale spatial and chemical resolution[15,16].","['fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2']",['tbl1']
3,Results and discussions,"The HEA was mechanically tested in tension and the engineering and true strain-stress curves are shown inFig. 3a. The true strain-stress curve can be well fitted using an exponential decay function combined with a linear function[17], suggesting that the true strain-stress curve follows a relationship that can be described by the equation:(1)σ(MPa)=146.74(MPa)+739.80(MPa)*ε−150.73(MPa)*(7.83E−10)εwhereσandεare true stress and true strain, respectively. The first term (146.74 MPa) is almost equivalent to 0.2% offset yield strength value (148 MPa) and the second term gives a constant work hardening rate (739.80 MPa). As the third term is sufficiently small in magnitude and approaches to zero after yielding, the Equation(1)can be simplified as a linear function:(2)σ(MPa)=146.74(MPa)+739.80(MPa)*ε","['fig3', 'fd1']",[]
3,Results and discussions,"The constant work hardening rate (seealsoFig. 3b), derived from first derivitate of the fitted true train-stress curve, suggests a linear work hardening during plastic deformation, which is similar to that in a coarse grained fcc-CoCrFeMnNi HEA[18]. In addition, the measured Young's modulusE(176 GPa) is very close to that (171–195 GPa), predicted by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and nanoindentation measurements[19]but smaller than that (215 GPa) measured by resonant ultrasound spectroscopy[20]from an alloy with a similar composition. To investigate the underlying deformation mechanisms, tensile tests were purposely interrupted at an engineering strain of ∼8% to facilitate TEM characterization of the dislocation structure.",['fig3'],[]
3,Results and discussions,"In contrast to the as-prepared alloy that has a very low density of dislocations (3 × 1012/m2), a large number of dislocations appear in different slip systems after ∼8% tensile deformation with a dislocation density of about 1 × 1014/m2to 2 × 1014/m2. The dislocation densities were measured by masking representative bright-field TEM images with grids and statistically analyszed the frequency of dislocation number in each grid. While, no deformation twins can be seen at the early stage of deformation in the sample (Fig. 4a), this is probably because twinning is a stress controlled deformation process in FCC metals. In the current deformation range, the flow stress may not be sufficiently high for twinning. However, we did see deformation twins in the late stage of deformation where the work hardening gives high flow strength of the material. The structure of dislocations in the deformed sample was characterized by STEM under a two-beam condition to enhance the diffraction contrast of dislocations. Combined with the high spatial resolution of Cs-corrected STEM, it is possible to image the dissociated partial dislocations in the bright-field (BF) mode which is usually cannot be achieved in conventional BF-TEM.Fig. 4a shows a BF-STEM image of dislocation networks in the deformed alloy. The imaging plane is approximately 35° oblique to the (111) slip plane and the [111] type diffraction vector in the two-beam condition is shown in the inset.Fig. 4b represents a zoom-in BF-STEM image of the deformation dislocations under a two-beam condition with the diffraction vector ofg=[220](seethe inset) and the dislocations lie on the (111) plane. The dissociation of dislocations with measureable core widths can be clearly seen in the image. The Burgers vectors (bp) of the dissociated dislocations are determined by the operation of|g·bp|with the invisible criterion of|g·bp|=0using weak beam dark field imaging as well as high resolution HRTEM/HRSTEM images. The dislocations have a Burgers vector of(a/2)<110>and the dissociated partials are determined to be Shockley partials with a Burgers vector of(a/6)<112>. The angle, α, between a dislocation line vector in the (111) plane and an operated diffraction vector can be used to identify the character of the dislocation as edge, screw, or mixed in nature. In our experiment, dislocations lie on the (111) habit plane, determined by tilt analysis (Fig. 4b) and thus is perpendicular to the electron beam incidence direction [111]. Since two partial dislocations are visible from two beam BF-STEM imaging experiments using [220] type diffraction vectors,|g·bp|=1, the diffraction vectors and the full Burgers vectors are parallel. Because all of these vectors are on the same plane, we could easily measure the dislocation character angles. As marked in the sequence of distances/angles inFig. 4b, the width between dissociated partial dislocations changes with local screw components of the dislocations (Fig. 4c). It is worth noting that most(a/2)<110>dislocations have a visible dissociated core with a width of about several to tens of nanometers. In addition to the dissociated dislocations, there are a large number of sessile dislocations with a density of ∼1 × 1012/m2(Fig. 5a), produced by the reactions of gliding dislocations on different {111} planes. The reaction portions lie on the planes that are not the slip planes and thus the sessile dislocations are immobile. Both Lomer locks, formed by two full dislocation reactions, and Lomer-Cottrell locks, by the reactions of two partials from two dissociated dislocations, are frequently observed in the alloy, indicating that extensive dislocation reactions take place during plastic deformation.Fig. 4d is an example showing multiple Lomer-Cottrell lock junctions, indicated by a arrowhead, at each crossover point of the dissociated dislocations from different slip planes. A zoom-in image (Fig. 4e) reveals the detail of a Lomer-Cottrell lock by the reaction of two(a/6)<112>partial dislocations from two different dissociated dislocations. The planar dislocation glide is dominated by screw partial dislocations as the Burgers loops around the partial pairs reveal no edge component, as shown in the HRTEM image (Fig. 5b). The partials of dislocations with the dissociated cores glide on the(111)plane and react with the partials of other dislocations that are from a different slip system and lie on the(111¯)plane. The reactions between the partial dislocations result in a high density of dislocation locks, which may serve as the Frank-Read dislocation sources and even nucleation sites for twinning in following large plastic deformation.","['fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig5', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig5']",[]
3,Results and discussions,"Fig. 6a is a high-resolution HAADF-STEM image of a dissociated(a/2)<110>dislocation taken along the [110] direction. The marked Burgers vector loop shows that the entire dislocation is a 60° full dislocation since only one set of the (111) planes have an extra half plane inserted[21]. Burgers direction of the dislocation lies on the (111) plane and is 60° to dislocation line direction, which is parallel to the[11¯0]direction. The separation distance of the two Shockley partials is ∼34 nm, which is surprisingly larger than those of conventional metals and alloys with a low stacking fault energy (SFE), for example pure Au[22,23]. The stacking fault with a lattice shift on a single {111} plane can be seen in the image taken from the middle part of the dissociated dislocation core (Fig. 6b). From the atomic image of each end of the dissociated dislocation, a partial dislocation with the Burgers vector of(a/6)[121¯]can be identified by measuring the length and also by considering the projection of Burgers vector magnitude in the FCC crystal (Fig. 6c). The dislocation core widths depend on the dislocation character and a pure screw dislocation usually has a narrower width of ∼10 nm, consistent with the BF-STEM observations. Based on the experimental measurements of the core widths of dislocations with different character angle α, the SFEs (γ) were calculated according to the anisotropic elasticity theory using the following equation:(3)γ=G|a2|2−ν48π1−ν·1d·1−2νcos2α2−νwhereais the lattice parameter taken from X-ray measurements (3.535 Å); theGandνare the isotropic shear modulus and Poisson's ratio, respectively. The values of the Poisson's and shear modulus are taken as 0.28 and 84 GPa from Ref.[20]for a alloy with a similar composition (without Al). The calculated SFE yields a value of 6–21 mJ/m2(Fig. 7), which is significantly smaller compared with the Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy (51 mJ/m2)[24]. The SFE values are comparable but obviously smaller than the CrMnFeCoNi HEA (30 ± 5 mJ/m2) reported by Okamoto et al. (Ref.[25]) and the CoCrNi HEA (22 ± 4 mJ/m2) reported by Laplanche et al. (Ref.[26]). This is possibly due to that the Al addition in our alloy may reduce the SFE of the CoCrFeNi HEA, similar to the Cu-Al alloy system in which the SFE value decreases with the increase of Al concentration[27–29]. On the other hand, adding more Al to CoCrFeNi may leads to local chemical ordering and phase separation, which may restrict the separation of dislocation cores and thus give a higher apparent SFE value.","['fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig7']",[]
3,Results and discussions,"The widely dissociated dislocation cores with two partials lead to extensive dislocation reactions and the formation of Lomer and Lomer-Cottrell locks in the deformed HEA (Fig. 4d), which are expected to be responsible for the high work hardening rate of HEAs. To view the interaction between dislocations, the atomic structures of the dislocation locks are imaged by real-space HAADF-STEM.Fig. 8a represents the atomic image of a Lomer lock junction. The Lomer dislocation with the Burgers vector ofb3=(a/2)[101]is formed by the reaction of two full dislocations,b1=(a/2)[011]on the(11¯1)plane andb2=(a/2)[11¯0]on the(111)plane:(4)a2[011]+a2[11¯0]→a2[101]","['fig4', 'fig8']",[]
3,Results and discussions,"The reaction product is a sessile dislocation junction since its Burgers vector is no longer on the active slip planes of(111)or(11¯1)of the primary dislocations. The strain mapping (Fig. 8b) shows that there is a large nonplanar strain field around the core of the sessile dislocation, resulting from the superposition of the dislocations involved in the reaction. The nonplanar strain field also increases the difficulty of the dislocation motion.",['fig8'],[]
3,Results and discussions,"The atomic structure of Lomer-Cottrell junctions in the current HEA was also imaged by high resolution STEM observations.Fig. 8c shows a HAADF-STEM image of a stair-rod dislocation with the Burgers vector of(a/6)[110], in which the sessile dislocation is produced by the reaction of two partial dislocations of widely dissociated dislocations on two different slip planes. The real-space atomic image shows that two dissociated dislocations have the Burgers vectors of(a/2)[101¯]and(a/2)[011]on(111)and(1¯11)planes, respectively. From the image, the dissociation reactions can be determined as:(5)a2[101¯]→a6[21¯1¯]+a6[112¯](6)a2[011]→a6[1¯21]+a6[112]",['fig8'],[]
3,Results and discussions,The leading and trailing partials react to form a stair-rod dislocation:(7)a6[21¯1¯]+a6[1¯21]→a6[110],[],[]
3,Results and discussions,"As shown in the high-resolution images, the resultant stair-rod dislocation is not on the active slip planes of(111)or(1¯11)and hence is immobile.",[],[]
3,Results and discussions,"The dissociated dislocations and a large number of immobile Lomer and Lomer-Cottrell locks (the density is about ∼1 × 1012/m2estimated from DF-TEM images) revealed by the atomic-scale characterization, certainly lead to the large work hardening rate of the single-phase FCC HEA. These immobile dislocation locks act as the Frank-Read sources for dislocation multiplication to form parallel long dislocations in the same slip systems (Fig. 5a), which gives rise to a linear increase of flow stress with plastic strain (Fig. 3). According to the Kocks–Mecking formulation[30], the evolution of the average dislocation density (ρ) with stain (ε) can be described as:(8)dρ/dε=(mρb−k·ρ)wherebis the magnitude of the Burgers vector,mis the storage coefficient, andkis the annihilation coefficient associated with dynamic recovery of dislocations. The widely dissociated dislocation cores and the easy formation of dislocation locks can effectively impede the dynamic recovery caused by the cross slip. Together with the large grain size and low initial dislocation density of the HEA, the annihilation term is not significant and the equation can be rewritten as:(9)dρ/dε=mρb","['fig5', 'fig3']",[]
3,Results and discussions,"The flow stress is determined by the average dislocation density based on the Taylor equation:(10)σ=σ0+η·G·bρwhereσ0is the intrinsic strength of the material with a low dislocation density;ηis a correction factor specific to the materials, andGis the shear modulus. Differentiating the Taylor equation at both sides with respect to the strain, we have(11)dσ/dε=0.5η·G·b·(1ρ)·dρdε,",[],[]
3,Results and discussions,"Insert Eq.(8)into Eq.(10), we obtain the constant strain hardening rate as:(12)dσ/dε=0.5η·G·m","['fd8', 'fd10']",[]
3,Results and discussions,"Thus, the linear strain hardening arises from the pure dislocation multiplication when the dislocation annihilation by dynamic recovery is absent. In principle, equation(4)should be applicable to any fully annealed FCC alloy with a large grain size and low dislocation density. However, the linear work hardening is rarely seen in conventional FCC metals and alloys, such as Al and Cu. It is worth noting that the high work hardening factor promotes uniform deformation, which may be associated with in the generic observations of high fracture toughness and ductility of single-phase FCC HEAs. It worth noting that the linear work hardening derived in this study can only be held at a relatively small strains at which the dislocation annihilation by dynamic recovery is ignorable. But, at large stains, the significant dislocation annihilation by dynamic recovery will take place and the linear relation will be broken down. Instead of dislocation multiplication, other work hardening mechanisms, such as twinning, may becomes dominant at high stress levels.",['fd4'],[]
3,Results and discussions,"Although Lomer and Lomer-Cottrell locks from the reactions of dissociated dislocations are not unique to HEAs and, in fact, often appear in FCC metals with a low stacking fault energy, direct visualization of the complex crystal defects on the atomic scale in real space remains challenging. A high density of the dislocation locks in the HEA, compared to convention FCC metals, provide a great opportunity to experimentally characterize the atomic structures of Lomer and Lomer-Cottrell locks using real-space imaging technique, HAADF-STEM. The large scatter of dislocation core widths observed in this study could be attributable to the variation of the environments of individual dislocations, such as dislocation-dislocation interactions, influence of surface tension of TEM foils, and possible heterogeneity from short-range chemical ordering. However, as a general rule, these environmental effects are expected to lead to the variation of dislocation core widths and, thus, the stacking fault energy range is derived from the widest and narrowest dislocation cores observed in this study and the mean value should be close to the intrinsic SFE of the HEA.",[],[]
4,Conclusion,"We systematically investigated the dislocation structure in a plastically deformed FCC HEA by employing the state-of-the-art Cs-corrected TEM. By measuring the widths of the dissociated dislocations cores, the stacking fault energy of the HEA is experimentally determined to be about 6–21 mJ/m2. The low stacking fault energy and thus widely dissociated dislocation cores lead to extensive dislocation reactions and the formation of immobile dislocation locks which, subsequently, act as both dislocation barriers and sources and are directly responsible for the significant work hardening with a large hardening rate. On the basis of the atomic-scale observations and classical dislocation theories, we derived a simple equation to describe the linear work hardening of the HEA at the early stage of deformation.",[],[]
