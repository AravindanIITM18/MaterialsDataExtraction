0,Abstract,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are a newly emerging class of materials that show attractive mechanical properties for structural applications. Particularly, face-centered cubic (fcc) structured HEAs and medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) such as FeMnCoNiCr and CoNiCr alloys, respectively, which exhibit superior fracture toughness and tensile properties at liquid nitrogen temperature, are the potential HEA materials available for cryogenic applications. Here, we report a ferrous Fe60Co15Ni15Cr10 (at%) MEA exhibiting combination of cryogenic tensile strength of ∼1.5 GPa and ductility of ∼87% due to the multiple-stage strain hardening. Astonishingly, detailed microstructural observations at each stage reveal the sequential operation of deformation-induced phase transformation from parent fcc to newly formed bcc (body-centered cubic) phases. No compositional heterogeneity is observed at phase boundaries, indicating diffusionless phase transformation, as confirmed by atom probe tomography. The transformation to bcc phase occurs predominantly along grain boundaries (GBs) at the early stage of plastic deformation. Simultaneously, numerous deformation-induced shear bands (SBs) having stacking faults associated to the Shockley partial dislocations and thin hcp plates, form within fcc grains. Further deformation leads to the intense nucleation and growth of the bcc phase at the intersections of SBs within fcc grains. These micro-processes consecutively enhance the strain hardening rate, which play a key role in the multiple strain hardening behavior. The in-situ neutron diffraction studies make it clear that the martensite formation and the concurrent load partitioning between the fcc and bcc phases play an important role in the increase in strength. Furthermore, replacing high-cost alloying elements cobalt and nickel with iron, as well as introduction of metastability-engineering at liquid nitrogen temperature, distinguishes the new ferrous MEAs from previously reported equiatomic HEAs. This result underlines insights to provide expanded opportunities for the future development of HEAs for cryogenic applications.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"With recent advances in the aerospace, marine shipbuilding, and natural gas industries, the demand for metallic alloys having desirable strength and ductility in cryogenic environments has been increased. The challenge in designing alloys is that many engineering alloys become embrittled at low temperatures, hence, their use at cryogenic temperatures is often limited [1–3]. Multicomponent alloys, referred to as high-entropy alloys (HEAs) or medium-entropy alloys (MEAs) depending on their configurational entropy of mixing, have recently drawn much interest due to their outstanding properties at elevated temperatures [4–6]. In particular, equiatomic FeMnCoNiCr and CoNiCr alloys compromising a single face-centered cubic (fcc) structure have been potential materials for cryogenic engineering uses owing to their superior synergy of fracture toughness and tensile properties at liquid nitrogen temperature [7–11]. The underlying strengthening mechanism upon cryogenic-temperature plastic deformation of these materials is the substantial interaction between lattice dislocations and nano-twins. Additionally, Miao et al. [12] suggested that the formation of nanotwin and hexagonal close-packed (hcp) lamellar structures at larger strain level is responsible for the superior tensile properties of CoNiCr alloy.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Recently, classical methods for strengthening materials, including nanostructuring, micro-band formation, mechanical twinning, or precipitation strengthening, have been successfully applied for improving the room-temperature mechanical properties of HEAs due to the demand for further enhancing mechanical properties [13–17]. Among these, metastability-engineering strategy [18], as a breakthrough of HEA design concept, enables the development of transformation-induced plasticity-assisted dual-phase Fe50Mn30Co10Cr10(at%) HEA. Destabilizing high-temperature fcc phase through reducing the Mn content in the HEA system, promotes deformation-induced phase transformation from fcc to hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase at room temperature, improving both strength and ductility. Also, the similar approach that was based on destabilizing body-centered cubic (bcc) phase by changing Ta content offers phase-transformation ductilization to brittle bcc structure in TaxHfZrTi HEA system [4]. These efforts suggest that the transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect manipulates the internal defect landscape of high-performance HEA or MEA for improving their strength without loss of ductility. However, despite such profound progress, the utilization of metastability-engineering strategy has so far been realized only for room-temperature conditions, and even few alloying systems. For exploiting the metastability measures having potentially great impacts on material's cryogenic-temperature mechanical properties, thus, research into a new HEA design approach is required.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Herein, we successfully exploit the metastability-engineering strategy under cryogenic conditions. Working toward this goal, we introduce fcc-structured Fex(CoNi)90-xCr10(at%) MEA system, and the rationale for this selection is that: (i) The Cr-rich σ phase has been reported in four-element FeCoNiCr system [19,20], thus reducing the Cr content down to 10 at% can suppress the formation of intermetallic compound. (ii) Ni stabilizes the fcc phase, given that substitution of Ni for Fe broadens fcc single-phase region in Fe-Ni binary system [21]. (iii) Co acts as an fcc stabilizer at high temperatures, while raises the martensite starting temperature at low temperatures in Fe-Co binary system [22–24].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"To most likely achieve the TRIP effects at cryogenic temperatures, we identify effects of alloying elements on phase constitution and on phase stability to introduce metastable fcc-structured solid solution, and newly design a ferrous Fex(CoNi)90-xCr10(x= 55, 57.5, and 60 at%) MEA system. The objective of the present work is to study the evolution of phase stability and transformation-induced microstructures during tensile loading at temperature ranging 77–298 K of the present MEA materials. Based on the results of microstructural analysis, combined within-situneutron diffraction analysis during tensile deformation at room- and low-temperatures (298 K and 136 K, respectively), we found that the underlying micro-processes of the present alloys under cryogenic loading involve deformation-induced phase transformation from metastable fcc to bcc phases, thereby leading to the TRIP effects; we were able to achieve more than triple its tensile strength than that of room-temperature one, while further gaining its ductility rather than sacrificing it. Our results are expected to provide a potent means for the future development of HEAs available for cryogenic applications.",[],[]
2,Experimental methods,"The present Fex(CoNi)90-xCr10(x= 55, 57.5, and 60) alloys were produced by employing vacuum induction melting equipment (model: MC100V, Indutherm, Walzbachtal-Wossingen, Germany) under an Ar atmosphere using pure metals (purity higher than 99.9%). Rectangular ingots with the dimensions of 100 × 35 × 8 mm3were homogenized at 1373 K for 6 hr, pickled in a 20% HCl, and milled to a thickness of 7 mm. The pickled ingots were rolled at room temperature with a thickness reduction ratio of ∼79% (from 7 to 1.5 mm). The rolled sheets were annealed at 1073 K for 10 min to obtain fully recrystallized microstructures, and subsequently water-quenched.",[],[]
2,Experimental methods,"Uniaxial tensile tests were conducted on specimens cut in the rolling direction. The plate-type sub-sized tensile specimens (gauge length: 6.4 mm, gauge width: 2.5 mm, thickness: 1.5 mm) were tested in tension at an engineering strain rate of 10−3s−1using a universal testing machine (Instron 1361, Instron Corp, Canton, MA, USA) at 77 and 298 K. A low-temperature chamber was attached to the universal testing machine in the case of the tensile tests at 77 K, and the temperature was controlled by an automatic cooling chamber system using liquid N2injection. Vickers microindents (300 g load) spaced ∼6.4 mm apart were made along the gauge lengthes of the tensile specimens to correct strain measurements obtained from the crosshead displacements. Three samples were tested at each temperature to confirm reproducibility of results, and the representative data were obtained by averaging three values at each data point and determining the standard deviation.",[],[]
2,Experimental methods,"Multiple characterization techniques were used to analyze the microstructures of the recrystallized and deformed non-equiatomic MEA samples. X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak profiles were recorded on the samples subject to heat treatment at 1073 K for 10 min, and using Cu Kαradiation of 0.15406 nm with a step scanning rate of 2 deg/min. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) measurements were performed with field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) equipped with a TSL EBSD system. The step size of the EBSD scan for the cryogenic-deformed samples was 92 nm, and a number of EBSD scans of each sample with the probed area of 481 × 112 μm2were performed for phase fraction measurements. The EBSD data were interpreted using orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) collection software (TSL OIM Analysis 7).",[],[]
2,Experimental methods,"To characterize the fcc/bcc interfaces, as primarily targeted in this work, the chemical composition of the phase boundaries was investigated using an atom probe tomography (APT) system (LEAP 4000X HR, Cameca Inc.) with a reflectron at the atomic scale. APT tips were prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB) milling system (FEI Helios Nanolab 650i) from regions of interest containing fcc/bcc phase boundaries detected through a prior EBSD scan. All the measurements were conducted with the voltage-pulsing mode at a detection rate of 0.2%; pulse fraction of 20%; and pulse repetition rate of 200 kHz. All measurements were performed at 60 K under a pressure of less than 10−7Pa. To observe microstructure evolution during plastic deformation at 77 K, the samples for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were produced by dual-beam focused ion beam (FIB, FEI Helios Nano-Lab™). Bright-field or high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) imaging, selected area diffraction patterns (SADPs) and high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) lattice micrographs were obtained with a JEOL 2200FS equipped with an aberration corrector operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV.",[],[]
2,Experimental methods,"To understand detailed strengthening mechanism of the present alloys,in-situneutron diffraction was conducted to monitor the structural evolution upon tensile loading at 298 K and 136 K. Plate-type tensile specimens with a gauge length of 25 mm, a gauge width of 4 mm, and a thickness of 1.5 mm along the rolling direction were prepared. The experiments were conducted at TAKUMI [25], a high resolution and high intensity time of flight (TOF) neutron diffractometer for engineering materials science at Materials and Life Science Experimental Facility of Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex. The neutron diffraction patterns in the axial and transverse directions were collected simultaneously using two detector banks with the scattering angles of ±90°. The samples were tested in tension in a step-load controlling manner with 600 s holding in elastic regime, and in a continuous manner with a constant engineering strain rate of 3 × 10−5s−1in the plastic regime. The data for the plastic regime were then extracted periodically with 300 s accumulating time for different applied strain. Data analyses were conducted using a Rietveld software called Z-Rietveld [26]. In addition, since the position of peaks with large intensities become dominant contributions to the lattice constants when using the Rietveld refinement [27], a single peak fitting method with the Z-Rietveld was used to determine phase strains and macroscopic lattice strains of each (hkl) peak.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Thermodynamic calculations for alloy design and microstructures,"The main aim of this work is to design new TRIP-aided FeCoNiCr alloys for use in cryogenic applications. In this regard, a specific challenge lies in determining the effects of alloy composition on the phase constitution and stability to determine target alloys that have suited compositions for exhibiting the TRIP effect at cryogenic temperature. We claim to have resolved this challenge with the aid of computational thermodynamics by using Thermo-Calc software [28] along with TCFE2000 and its upgraded version [29,30].Fig. 1a shows isothermal section diagrams in the (Fe,Co,Ni)90Cr10alloy system at 1093 K. In the Fex(CoNi)90-xCr10system, the fcc phase is stable over a wide composition range. On the other hand, the free energy differences between fcc and bcc phases, ΔG(fcc → bcc), and between fcc and hcp phases, ΔG(fcc → hcp), indicate that reduction of (CoNi) contents destabilizes the fcc phase at 298 K, as shown inFig. 1b. Specifically, the free energy differences of Fe60Co15Ni15Cr10alloy has strong temperature dependencies, and bcc phase becomes more stable than fcc and hcp phases as the temperature decreases, seeFig. 1c. These variations in Gibbs free energy indicate two potentials: (i) to form fcc single phase by heat treatment at 1093 K followed by quenching and (ii) to cause phase transformation from metastable fcc to bcc when the deformation energy overcomes the energy barrier for phase transformation during deformation at low temperatures. In this regard, to identify the most beneficial amount of Fe for reducing the stability of the parent fcc matrix at cryogenic temperatures, we selected the composition of the ferrous MEAs by tailoring the alloy composition: Fe60Co15Ni15Cr10(denoted as Fe60 hereafter) and set Fe57.5 and Fe55 as control groups,Fig. 1a. Microstructure characterization, determined using XRD and EBSD, confirms that the three different Fe55, Fe57.5, and Fe60 alloys consisted of near-single fcc phase with grain sizes of ∼6.5 μm at room temperature, as shown inFig. 2.","['fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig2']",[]
3.2,Results.Tensile properties and strain-hardening behavior,"Representative engineering stress-strain curves of the present alloys, obtained at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) and at room temperature (298 K), are shown inFig. 3a. The mechanical responses of the materials show two distinct features with respect to the controlled phase stability. Firstly, the cryogenic-temperature tensile strength of all materials increased dramatically with decreasing the tensile testing temperatures from 298 to 77 K. The increment in tensile strength due to a decrease in the temperatures represents generally-known mechanical responses associated with thermally-activated process of other metallic alloys for a given microstructure [31]. The second feature is that a substantial increase in cryogenic-temperature tensile strength could be attained at comparable tensile ductility with the room-temperature one, when Fe = 60 at%. In comparison to the room-temperature tensile properties, the cryogenic-temperature strength up to 170% was raised at comparable ductility (5% reduction in the absolute level of total tensile elongation). To emphasize the substantial improvement in the properties of the present alloys upon cryogenic deformation, the results of other recently developed structural alloys, such as twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP) steels [32], 9% Ni-alloy [33], austenitic stainless steels [34,35], and the previously reported HEAs or MEAs [7–9,36–38], are shown inFig. 3b. This comparison shows that controlling fcc phase stability by means of compositional modification leads for the present alloys to up to ultimate tensile strength of 1510 MPa and ductility of ∼88% in cryogenic-temperature tensile properties, relative to corresponding property profiles of the given reference alloys. This result demonstrates that metastability-engineering strategy is an efficient method for attaining better cryogenic-temperature mechanical properties of the HEAs.","['fig3', 'fig3']",[]
3.2,Results.Tensile properties and strain-hardening behavior,"The strain-hardening rate, derived from the corresponding true stress-true strain curves at 77 K, is provided inFig. 3c. The strain-hardening rate of the Fe55 alloy gradually decreased with increasing strains, while it fluctuated at the late stage of deformation. For the Fe57.5 alloy, the strain-hardening rate gradually decreased, followed by an up-turn over a wide range of strains from 28% to 63%. When focusing more on the Fe60 alloy, the strain-hardening rate exhibits an unusual multiple strain-hardening capability. The strain-hardening rate of this alloy dropped sharply by elastic-plastic transition in the initial stage (referred to as stage I), followed by a steep up-turn at the true strain of ∼7.8%. As the true strains increased from 7.8% to 40.0%, strain-hardening rate was classified into three different stages (from stage II to stage IV). These multiple stages over a broad strain regime lead for the Fe60 alloy to a remarkable increase in tensile strength at comparable ductility during plastic deformation at 77 K. This observation gives a strong indication of the activation of a sequential strain hardening mechanisms.",['fig3'],[]
3.3,Results.Microstructural evolution during tensile deformation at room- and cryogenic-temperatures,"The variation in the area fractions of newly formed bcc phase during cryogenic deformation, determined from EBSD measurements, is shown inFig. 4a. This microstructure change performs twofold: (i) The fraction of bcc phase increases with increasing applied true strains, confirming that the present alloys benefit from the TRIP effects. (ii) The higher the Fe contents, the faster the transformation kinetics when mechanically loaded at 77 K. This is analogous to the above-mentioned thermodynamic calculation results that ΔG(fcc → bcc)decreases with increasing Fe contents (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the joint effect of increased Fe and reduced (CoNi) contents destabilizes fcc grains at 77 K, thereby producing much more TRIP effects for the Fe60 alloy over a wide strain regime, even at low true strain level of 10%.","['fig4', 'fig1']",[]
3.3,Results.Microstructural evolution during tensile deformation at room- and cryogenic-temperatures,"To identify chemical heterogeneity between the host fcc and the newly formed bcc phases during cryogenic deformation at the atomic scale, we performed APT on the cryogenic-deformed specimens of the Fe60 alloy. The atom maps of alloying elements, taken from the prior EBSD scans of regions containing the fcc/bcc phase boundaries, show no compositional heterogeneity between two phases, seeFig. 4b. Also, the corresponding statistical binomial frequency distribution analyses,Fig. 4c, confirmed a uniform distribution of all elements between both phases. The statistical analysis shows that the APT sample has an overall composition of Fe59.7Co15.3Ni15.3Cr9.7(at%). The binomial fitting of all four substitutional elements, obtained from the experiments, corresponds to a totally random distribution. We used several parameters to quantify the quality of the fit, as shown in the insert table inFig. 4c. Thendis the number of the degrees of freedom for a given ion. Especially, the values of the normalized homogenization parameterμfor all four elements are close to zero, which signifies a random distribution of the alloying elements between the two different crystal structures. From these APT experiments, the deformation-induced martensitic transformation proceeds by diffusionless or displacive transformation, suggesting that both phases could benefit from the considerable level of substitutional solid solution strengthening [18].","['fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4']",[]
3.3,Results.Microstructural evolution during tensile deformation at room- and cryogenic-temperatures,"To understand the strengthening mechanism and its effects on multiple strain-hardening behavior, we performed EBSD and TEM analyses on the 77 K-deformed samples of the Fe60 alloy. The microstructure evolution during plastic deformation at 77 K, taken from the different true strains, reveals that the underlying deformation mechanism is the phase transformation from fcc (red) to bcc (green) phases, shown in the EBSD maps (Fig. 5a). More interesting feature is the occurrence of sequential phase transformation that occurs at two different sites, i.e. grain boundaries (GBs) and metastable fcc intergrains. This observation has an excellent agreement with the TEM micrographs of the 77 K-deformed Fe60 samples,Fig. 5b. In the range of true strains between 10% (stage II in strain-hardening rate) to 20% (stage III), the transformation from fcc to bcc phases occurred predominantly at the GBs, as indicated by blue arrows. The deformation-induced microstructure at GBs acts as obstacles against dislocation glide, and as important sources of the strain hardening increase by the TRIP effect. This experiment suggests that the TRIP effect becomes much more pronounced at the GBs at the early stages of 77 K-deformation, yielding an increase in the strain-hardening rate. Meanwhile, very small fraction of nanometer-sized particles of the bcc phase was formed at the intersecting zone of deformation-induced shear bands (SBs) within the fcc grains, as outlined by red arrows. HR-TEM micrograph of deformation structure at the true strain of 10%, inset inFig. 5b, confirms that a large number of deformation-induced SBs in fcc grains consists of stacking faults (resulting from glide of Shockley partial dislocations with a 1/6<112> Burgers vector) and thin plates of hcp structure arising from several atomic monolayers of stacking faults (Supplementary Information Fig. S1) [39]. Also, inset inFig. 5b is the representative diffraction pattern, taken from a region containing newly formed bcc structure. In the diffraction pattern indexed as [011]fcc, the bcc diffraction spots that obey Kurdjumov-Sachs (K-S) orientation relationship with the adjacent fcc grain are visible [40]. The bcc phase with a K-S orientation relationship was rotated by 4.78° around [001]fcc, indicating the formation of a semi-coherent interface during fcc-to-bcc phase transformation.","['fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5']",[]
3.3,Results.Microstructural evolution during tensile deformation at room- and cryogenic-temperatures,"Upon further true strains ≥0.3 at 77 K (corresponding to stage IV in strain-hardening rate), newly formed bcc phases were formed more intensively and largely grown at the fcc intergrains rather than did at the GBs. This observation suggests that upon high strain levels at 77 K, the TRIP effect becomes much more pronounced at the intergrains rather than at the GBs. This TRIP effect at the intergrains contributes to the steep increase at stage IV in the strain-hardening rate of the alloy (Fig. 3c) due to autocatalytic effect [41].",['fig3'],[]
3.4,Results.In-situ neutron diffraction analysis,"For studying transformation behavior and micromechanical processes of individual phases,in-situneutron diffraction under continuous tensile deformation was conducted at room- and low-temperatures. The high resolution of neutron diffractometer and high beam intensity that realized continuous plastic deformation without the stress relaxation in the plastic regime enabled us to monitor the detailed structural information of bulk materials.Fig. 6presents neutron diffraction patterns of the Fe60 alloy at various true stresses tested at 298 K (Fig. 6a) and 136 K (Fig. 6b), collected from the axial direction. The diffraction patterns obtained at low true stress (<45 MPa) mainly exhibit fcc phase peaks. The calculated lattice parameters of the fcc phase at 298 and 136 K are 3.577 and 3.568 Å, respectively. The decrease in the lattice parameter of the fcc phase at 136 K can be related to the intrinsic nature of thermal expansion as a result of decreasing atomic thermal vibrations from their equilibrium positions [42].","['fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6']",[]

Before loading, only fcc phase appears in the undeformed samples at both temperatures; the volume fraction of the fcc phase remains with increasing applied true strain at 298 K. On the other hand, with increasing strain at 136 K, the result clearly shows the strain-induced martensitic transformation, where the metastable fcc phase transforms to the bcc phase. The bcc phase fraction starts to increase as the deformation proceeds, and the increase becomes linear above the applied true strain of 0.1.",['fig7'],[]

The lattice spaing of the fcc phase obtained before deformation were used as thedhkl0values for the fcc phase.

3.4,Results.In-situ neutron diffraction analysis,"Fig. 7c and d shows the results ofƐhklin the axial direction as a function of applied true stress. At 298 K (Fig. 7c), it is seen that the strain responses of each (hkl) planes for the fcc phase were linear in elastic regime, and the slopes were different depending on the crystal orientation, i.e., elastic anisotropy [49]. After elasto-plastic transition, the fcc phase plastically deformed and the {200} grains exhibited the largest elastic strain along the loading direction, while the {111} grains exhibited the lowest elastic strain, similar to the typical deformation characteristics of normal fcc metals [50]. Since the martensitic transformation rarely occurs during room-temperature deformation, the load transferring from softer grain families to harder grain families occurred within fcc phases. At 136 K (Fig. 7d), theƐhklresponses show a larger applied true stress limit of the linearity than that at 298 K due to the temperature dependence of the elastic limit. More importantly, the martensitic transformation played an important role in the internal stress development. After elasto-plastic transition of the fcc phase, the fcc phase plastically deformed and the deformation-induced transformation proceeded at the beginning of the plastic deformation. It is seen that theƐhklresponses of the fcc phase deviated towards lower lattice strain from the linearity after yielding, indicating the compressive internal stresses developing in this phase due to the load partitioning of the newly formed bcc phase. On the other hand, the newly formed bcc phase deviated to the larger lattice strain, indicating the tensile internal stress was generated in this phase. With increasing the applied stress, the bcc phase fraction increased, and, thus, the bcc phase shared the applied stress, playing an important role in strengthening itself.","['fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7']",[]
4,Discussion,"The present ferrous MEAs are designed to trigger the martensitic transformation of the metastable fcc phase to the bcc phase at liquid nitrogen temperature. The introduced alloys are based on Fex(CoNi)90−xCr10 alloy system, while HEAs were initially defined as multicomponent alloys consisting of at least five principal elements of concentration between 5 and 35 at%, to maximize the configurational entropy and form random solid solutions [5]. Despite the decreased configurational entropy, the microstructure of these alloys remains a random solid solution in the fcc phase and bcc phase originated from the diffusionless transformation (Figs. 2 and 4). Thus, the alloys yet benefit from the massive substitutional solid solution strengthening, and resembles the well-studied HEAs. The partial substitution of the inexpensive Fe for high-cost alloying elements Co and Ni enables not only tuning of fcc phase stability and transformation potency, thereby proving it an effective metastability-engineering tool (Fig. 1), but also lowering of material cost (Supplementary Information Fig. S2).","['fig1', 'fig2', 'fig4']",[]
4,Discussion,"As evident from the changes in volume fraction of the newly formed bcc phase during plastic deformation at 77 K and 298 K (Supplementary Information Fig. S3) and the neutron diffraction results (Fig. 7), a decrease in the tensile testing temperatures promotes the deformation-induced phase transformation from fcc to bcc phases. In this regard, decreasing (CoNi) contents or increasing Fe contents plays the key role in controlling theΔG(fcc → bcc), transformation potency, and hence of the mechanical response with respect to the testing temperatures. To our surprise, the phase transformation during 77 K-deformation of the present ferrous MEAs improves both tensile strength and ductility dramatically,Fig. 3a. In other metallic alloys, it is known that phase-transformation from fcc to bcc phases is detrimental to tensile ductility at low temperatures, yielding earlier sample failure by ductile-to-brittle transition characteristics [32,51–53]. This discrepancy could be due to the difference in TRIP effects between two sets of observations.","['fig7', 'fig3']",[]
4,Discussion,"Thein-situneutron diffraction analysis at room- and low-temperatures convincingly demonstrates collaborative deformation behavior between the metastable fcc phase and newly formed bcc phase (Fig. 7). The newly formed bcc phase share the load and plays a role in work-hardening.Fig. 8shows a schematic illustration of the multiple work-hardening capability and associated microstructure evolution during 77 K-deformation of the Fe60 alloy. We note that the Fe60 alloy composed of near-single fcc solid solution in the recrystallized state, as given inFig. 2d. The initial drop in strain-hardening rate in stage I correlates to the conventional elastic-plastic transition. At the beginning of the plastic deformation (stage II), a steep up-turn of work-hardening rate is due to newly formed bcc phases along GBs. The driving force for nucleation of bcc phases at GBs originates from the high excess energy of numerous GBs. Simultaneously, the SBs become to appear at intergrains, followed by formation of bcc phase at the intersecting zone of SBs once it overcomes the nucleation barrier. However, due to its small volume fraction in this stage, the occurrence of bcc phase is probably insufficient for acquiring the transformation-related plasticity. At stage III, bcc phases at the intersecting zone of SBs undergo growth intensively before the phase transformation at the GBs is terminated. Hence, the substantial increase in strain-hardening rate after stage II originates from the transformation at the intergrains. As a result, the strain-hardening response over a wide strain regime benefits from the TRIP effects that sequentially act at the GBs and at the SBs. This is well documented by EBSD and TEM analyses (seeFig. 5). It has been reported that the martensitic transformation has strong relations with the strain rate and temperature [32]. The above discussion suggests that the tendency to the formation of bcc martensite is sensitive to the temperature. Since ΔG is also temperature-dependent, the transformation rate is sensitive to the temperature, as well. Hence, the decrease in the chemical driving force ΔG(fcc → bcc)with increasing temperature leads to the suppression of the martensitic transformation. Numerous investigations of the strain-rate effect on martensitic transformation have shown that the transformation is suppressed with increasing strain rate, and this has been explained in terms of the adiabatic heating, which decreases the chemical driving force [54,55]. Meanwhile, at strain rates where the adiabatic heating does not occur, previous study showed that the volume fraction of bcc martensite at the same true strain decreases with an increase in strain rate [56]. According to Olson et al. [57], the volume fraction of shear bands in the austenite,fsb= 1 – exp (−α×Ɛ) (α: strain-independent constant,Ɛ: applied plastic strain), is expected to increase with increasing strain rate due to the fact that theαparameter is thought to be dependent on strain rate. Increased volume fraction of shear bands leads to an increase in the number of shear-band intersections, and hence of volume fraction of martensite. Thein-situneutron diffraction analysis was carried out with a constant strain rate of 3 × 10−5s−1at 136 K, while the cryogenic-temperature tensile test was conducted with a strain rate of 10−3s−1at 77 K. Therefore, the transformation rate and phase fraction of bcc martensite under the strain rate of 10−3s−1at 77 K are expected to be higher than those based on the neutron diffraction analysis. Nevertheless, thein-situneutron diffraction analysis at 136 K describes the martensite formation and the concurrent load partitioning between the fcc and bcc phases well, and these can be applied even at 77 K.","['fig7', 'fig8', 'fig2', 'fig5']",[]
4,Discussion,"The deformation-induced phase transformation in austenitic stainless steels has been frequently reported, where the SFE is low [33,39,55,56]. An austenite phase of most austenitic stainless steels is metastable phase at or below room temperature. Therefore, applied stress or plastic deformation causes diffusionless phase transformation of the parent austenite to martensite. It is well established that bcc α′-martensite is nucleated at the intersection of the deformation twins, Ɛ-martensite (hcp) phase, and shear bands. The shear bands consist of more or less faulted hcp phase depending on the SFE. The low SFE promotes the overlapping of the stacking faults on every second {111} plane, leading to the formation of more perfect Ɛ-martensite (hcp) phase [39]. On the other hand, Suzuki et al. [58] showed that α′-martensite are all formed along the intersection of two shear bands, with no trace of Ɛ-martensite. This indicates that the formation of α′-martensite is closely related to the intersection of shear bands, rather than hcp phase. In the present results, the evolution of deformation substructure shows that the bcc martensites are nucleated along the intersecting zone of shear bands (Fig. 5b). Specifically, high-resolution TEM micrograph and corresponding SADP reveal that the newly formed martensites exhibit no tetragonality (Supplementary Information Fig. S4). The microstructural observations also confirm the small trace of thin hcp plates by overlapping of stacking faults in the shear bands, and these act as effective nucleation sites for bcc martensites, considering the crystallographic shear operations of bcc martensitic transformation [59]. On the other hand, the bcc martensites are also formed at the intersection of shear bands with no trace of hcp phase and deformation twins. Therefore, the precursor for the formation of bcc martensite, in the present alloy, is the intersection of shear bands.",['fig5'],[]
4,Discussion,"Interface strengthening via the formation of fcc-hcp and fcc-bcc interfaces could also contribute to the enhanced cryogenic mechanical response of the Fe60 alloy. We focus here on the role of their interfaces on the strengthening effect, based on the following considerations.(1)A coherent fcc-hcp interface: As shown by Miao et al. [12], even small fcc to hcp transformations can dramatically strengthen a CoNiCr equiatomic alloy due to the difficulty in slip transmission across those interfaces. Since the hcp plates involve a large number of stacking faults and Shockley partial dislocations, they may be responsible for the barriers to dislocation motion. Indeed, the presence of stacking faults and Shockley partial dislocations within hcp structure, observed in the current TEM micrographs, supports the fcc-hcp interface strengthening.(2)A coherent fcc-bcc interface: Assuming the interfaces are coherent, difficulty of slip transmission from fcc to bcc is intuitively less than that from fcc to hcp. For the coherent interface with no misfit dislocations, the lattice volume compression or expansion is greatly increased. As such, the lattice misfit distortion associated with fcc-to-bcc transformation,B=Gs2(2 –υ)/8(1 –υ) (B,distortion energy for a displacive transformation;G, shear modulus;s, net shear in a plane; andυ, Poisson ratio) [60], can generate a large number of dislocations during lattice volume expansion. These dislocations act as additional source for increased plasticity, thereby counteracting the onset of necking [31]. This effect distinguishes the present MEAs from other recently developed TRIP-assisted HEAs [4,18]. Moreover, according to Weidner et al. [61], very fine α′-martensites sufficiently act as an obstacle for dislocation motion by reducing the mean free path of incident lattice dislocations [62].(3)A semi-coherent or incoherent fcc-bcc interface: The TEM analysis reveals that the newly formed bcc martensite with a diameter < 50 nm produced a semi-coherent interface with the adjacent fcc grain (Fig. 5b). As proposed in the earlier study [63], the coherent interface of α′-martensite with the parent γ-austenite grain probably becomes semi-coherent or incoherent when the α′-martensite grows further. This means that the growth of the martensite enables a loss of coherency with the adjacent fcc grain by generating a large number of interfacial misfit dislocations. In contrast to the foregoing coherent interfaces, the misfit dislocations at the semi-coherent or incoherent interfaces may block the interface penetration of the incident dislocations by themselves. Therefore, such crystal lattice defects could perform as a physical barrier for slip transmission.",['fig5'],[]

4,Discussion,"The foregoing three cases lead to the interface strengthening documented in this study. Hence, the interface formation through the martensitic transformation during cryogenic-temperature deformation, plays an important part in the significant increase of work-hardening and in the excellent combination of cryogenic strength and ductility. Yet, further quantitative studies are required to fully understand the complex interplay of interface mechanics and deformation-driven dislocation activities.",[],[]
5,Conclusion,"We successfully exploited metastability-engineering measures under cryogenic conditions through the new material creation of the non-equiatomic Fex(CoNi)90-xCr10alloy system. Two beneficial features were acquired by partially substituting inexpensive Fe for expensive (CoNi) elements: (i) It offered a novel route to develop cost-effective HEA materials, and (ii) it played a key role in controlling either phase stability or metastability itself at low temperatures. The underlying deformation mechanisms during cryogenic deformation of an fcc-structured Fe60Co15Ni15Cr10alloy were associated with dislocation slip and deformation-induced phase transformation from fcc to bcc phases. In particular, the superposition of strain hardening sources associated with phase transformations, one originating from the preferential nucleation sites (namely, GBs) and the other from autocatalytic nucleation and growth within grains, gave rise to extraordinary and endurable strain hardening capability leading to outstanding cryogenic-temperature mechanical properties. Hence, we suggest that the present ferrous MEAs exhibiting a good combination of strength and ductility can expand the possibility for the future development of structural materials available for cryogenic-temperature applications.",[],[]
