(a) Isothermal section diagram of the Fe-Co-Ni ternary system at 1073 K. (b) Variation of the free energy differences, ΔG(fcc → hcp)and ΔG(fcc → bcc), with the concentration in atomic percent of (CoNi) for each phase at 298 K. (c) Variation of the free energy differences in alloy Fe60 as a function of temperature. T0in (c) corresponds to the temperature at which ΔG(fcc → bcc)equals zero."

(a) Engineering stress-strain curves, showing a significant increase in yield strength and ultimate tensile strength with respect to temperature drop from room-temperature down to cryogenic temperature. (b) Comparison of the ultimate tensile strength versus elongation-to-failure at 77 K obtained in this work with other selected alloys [7–9,32–38]. (c) Strain hardening responses derived from the true stress-strain curves."

(a) Variation in the area fractions of bcc phase obtained by EBSD analysis at different strain levels at 77 K. (b) APT reconstructions of Fe, Co, Ni, and Cr atom, taken from a prior-EBSD scan of the fcc/bcc interface of the alloy Fe60.

(a) EBSD phase maps showing the deformation-induced phase transformation. (b) TEM analysis under each strain level showing the formation of bcc phase at GBs (blue arrow) and at intersecting zone of shear bands in fcc grains (red arrow). Inset in (b) at a true strain of 10% shows high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image, obtained from the enlarged region showing the formation of deformation-induced bcc phase at the intersecting zone of SBs. The diffraction patterns at true strains of 10% and 20% are indexed as [011]fcc; the position of bcc diffraction spots for a Kurdjumov-Sachs orientation relationship [40], are drawn into the image. GB: grain boundary, SB: shear band. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)"

The patterns were obtained from the axial direction of the samples during tensile deformation. The diffraction patterns mainly exhibit fcc phase peaks before loading at both temperatures, and the bcc peaks increase with increasing applied stress during tensile deformation at 136 K."

(a) Phase fractions of fcc and bcc phases as a function of applied true strain at 298 K and 136 K.

The sequential martensitic transformation during deformation consecutively enhances the strain hardening rate, which plays the key role to the multiple strain hardening behavior, thereby leading to the novel mechanical properties at cryogenic temperature."
