0,Abstract,"The effects of Al and Ti contents on the microstructures and high temperature properties of AlxCo1.5CrFeNi1.5Tiy (x, y values in molar ratio, x + y = 0.5) high entropy alloys have been investigated. With an increase in Al content and a decrease in Ti concentrations, precipitated phases in the FCC high entropy γ matrix can evolve from η to γ′ to β phases. Some of these alloys can possess high hardness values at elevated temperatures due to γ′ precipitations, and continuous Cr2O3 can form on the surfaces of these alloys for protection against oxidation. This study can serve as a guideline for future high entropy alloy design for high temperature applications.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Without a based element, high entropy alloys can possess a variety of crystal structures, microstructures, and properties. Examples include FCC high entropy alloys, such as CoCrFeMnNi[1–3]and AlCoCrCuFeNi[4–6]; BCC high entropy alloys, such as WNbMoTaV[7,8]and HfNbTaTiZr[9–11]. High entropy alloys can exhibit high wear resistance[12,13], high hardness[13,14], significant high temperature compressive strength[8,10], and good corrosion resistance[15,16]. High entropy alloys can be single phase alloys[1–3,7,17], or they can contain several types of intermetallic phases, such as β[18,19], Laves[20,21]and σ[19,22]. Furthermore, high entropy alloys can exhibit sluggish diffusion effect to enhance the thermal stability of the microstructure[1,23,24].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Phases formed in multi-components alloy systems can be detrimental or beneficial to properties. For conventional superalloys, a type of high temperature phase instability associated with topologically closed packed (TCP) phases formation can cause deterioration on mechanical properties[25,26], this is due to the softening of the γ matrix resulting from depletion in strengthening elements such as W, Cr, Mo or Re[25,27]. On the other hand, the common strengthening precipitate in Fe–Ni and Ni-based superalloys is L12γ′[28,29]. γ′ precipitates are coherently embedded in γ matrix, and it can hinder the motion of dislocations effectively[30]. Moreover, γ′ particles at grain boundary can hinder grain boundary migration during thermal exposure[31]. In our previous work[32], Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.5high entropy alloy can also contain γ′ precipitates, but the γ′ phase in this alloy is metastable and can transform into η phase. η phase is known to be brittle with little strain tolerance[33], so the transformation of γ′ to η phase should be avoided. This work aims to optimize Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.5high entropy alloy by studying the effect of Ti substitution by Al in AlxCo1.5CrFeNi1.5Tiy(x, y values in molar ratio, x + y = 0.5); this is to increase the thermal stability of γ′ phase by substituting the η forming Ti by Al[32,33]. High temperature properties in terms of hardness and oxidation behaviors are presented and discussed. The present research can help the future alloy design of high entropy alloys toward high temperature structural applications.",[],[]
2,Experimental methods,"The compositions of interest in this work have included Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.5(Ti05), Al0.1Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.4(Al01Ti04), Al0.2Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.3(Al02Ti03), and Al0.3Co1.5CrFeNi1.5Ti0.2(Al03Ti02),Table 1.",[],['tbl1']
2,Experimental methods,"Samples of all alloys were prepared by arc-melting process in an argon atmosphere. As-cast samples were solution heat treated at 1150 °C for 6 h followed by water quench, then aged at various temperatures from 650 °C to 900 °C to precipitate γ′ particles. All specimens were etched by 70% H3PO4, and microstructures were analyzed by Hitachi SU8010 scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). The volume fraction and size of γ′ particles were estimated by ImageJ software. Heat treated samples were examined by transmission electron microscope (Tecnai F30 TEM) under 300 kV; specimens were prepared by twin-jet polishing in a solution of 10% HClO4in CH3OH. X-ray diffractometer (SHIMADZU XRD-6000) equipped with Cu (Kα radiation = 1.5406 Å) target was utilized to analyze phase constituents on samples with plate geometry.",[],[]
2,Experimental methods,"Pyris Diamond TG/DTA was used to examine the thermal properties of samples of 30 mg in an Al2O3crucible at temperatures from 25 to 1420 °C with a heating rate of 10 °C/min and 200 sccm of Ar flow. To measure the compositions of γ and γ′ phases, microstructures had been coarsened by strain aging method, which was accomplished by firstly cold work on as-homogenized samples, then aged at 750 °C for 200 h to allow the coarsening of γ and γ′ phases for EDS analysis.",[],[]
2,Experimental methods,"Although alloys in present study are multi-phases HEA, precipitates can all be solutioned into single phase FCC matrix above the solvus temperatures of intermetallics. By referring to Boltzmann's hypothesis, the mixing entropy, ΔSmix, of a n-element random solid-solution state can be calculated[34], and the ΔSmixfor each alloy is presented inTable 1:ΔSmix=-R(XAlnXA+XBlnXB+…+XnlnXn)where XAis the molar ratio of A element, XBis the molar ratio of B element, etc. R is the gas constant (8.314 J/K mole).",[],['tbl1']
2,Experimental methods,"Hardness of samples were measured by a high temperature Vickers hardness tester (Model AVK-HF, Akashi) equipped with a vacuum chamber and a heating unit. All specimens were tested at room temperature and from 500 °C to 1000 °C at an interval of 100 °C under the argon pressure close to 1 atm. A load of 49 N and a dwell time of 15 s was used. The heating rate of the sample was 10 °C/min and three indentations were made to get an average value. The indentor material was diamond, and indentation positions were all within individual grains. Isothermal oxidation tests were conducted at 900 °C for 200 h. All specimen surfaces were grinded by #1200 sand paper before oxidation test. The oxidation weight gains of specimens were measured by digital weighing scale, and cross sections were examined by SEM and EDS analysis. A sample of Inconel 718 sample, which was processed by the standard heat treatment (as solutioned + 720 °C/8 h (furnace cooling) + 620 °C/8 h (air cooling)) was used for comparative study.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructure evolution,"Equilibrium phase constituents in these high entropy alloys can be described by Thermo-Calc (TCNI5 database)[35],Fig. 1(a). With an increase in Al content, the microstructures of these alloys can evolve from η + γ to η + γ + γ′ to γ + γ′ to β + γ + γ′ to β + γ for Ti05, Al01Ti04, Al02Ti03, Al03Ti02, and Al05, respectively; only Al02Ti03can possess equilibrium γ and γ′ two phases structure. XRD analysis on aged specimens (900 °C/50 h) has confirmed the presence of η and β in the high Ti and high Al containing alloys, respectively,Fig. 1(b).","['fig1', 'fig1']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructure evolution,"However, microstructure observations on samples aged at 750 °C for 50 h have revealed that main phase constituents in Ti05are γ and γ′,Fig. 2(a), which indicates sluggish γ′ to η phase transformation in Ti05. After Ti05has been aged at 900 °C for 50 h, plate-like η can be observed,Fig. 2(b). With an increase in Al content, phase stability of γ′ can be enhanced, the as heat treated Al01Ti04and Al02Ti03can exhibit stable γ and γ′ from 750 °C up to 900 °C,Fig. 2(c) to (f). Although η has been presented as an equilibrium phase in Al01Ti04according toFig. 1, sluggish diffusion can render a microstructure containing no η phase,Fig. 2(d).Fig. 2(g) and (h) show a TEM micrograph of nano size γ′ particles and its diffraction patterns in Al02Ti03(aged at 750 °C for 50 h). The superlattice reflections of γ′ can be observed, and the average size of γ′ is 31 nm; the lattice misfit between γ and γ′ has been estimated to be about 0.2%, which is confirmed by the spherical morphology of γ′ particles shown inFig. 2(g).Fig. 3(a) shows that after ageing at 1000 °C for 50 h, Al01Ti04contains needle-like η phase, and some γ′ precipitates can still be observed; β phase in Al05can be detected after 900 °C ageing for 50 h,Fig. 3(b). According to the compositions of γ and γ′ shown inTable 2, the entropy term in γ′ phase is increased with increasing Al substitution to Ti, this can destabilize γ′ by decreasing the solvus temperature of γ′,Table 1. The increase in Al content has prevented the η phase formation, hence the thermal stability of γ′ is improved in this respect. Comparing to conventional Ni-based superalloys, these high entropy alloys contain relatively high level of Fe content, however it can possess stable γ - γ′ microstructure at high temperatures.","['fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig1', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig3', 'fig3']","['tbl2', 'tbl1']"
3.2,Results and discussion.Thermal properties,"Fig. 4shows the results of DTA analysis on samples aged at 900 °C for 50 h, and the γ′ solvus temperatures of heat treated samples are also listed inTable 1. The solvus temperatures of η and γ′ phases, as well as the solidus temperatures have been verified with microstructure analysis on samples heat treated above and below the temperatures given inTable 1. Al addition can eliminate η phase formation, and allows the equilibrium γ′ solvus temperature to peak at 1010 °C,Fig. 1. However, higher Al/Ti ratio can decrease the solvus temperature of non-equilibrium γ′, increase the solidus, and induce the formation of detrimental β phase,Fig. 4. DTA has not been able to detect η solvus temperatures in Al01Ti04, which has been aged at 900 °C for 50 h, since diffusion in high entropy alloy is too sluggish to complete γ′ to η phase transformation during DTA analysis. With an increase in Al content, the heat treatment window appears to be increased. The heat treatment window between equilibrium η solvus and solidus of Al01Ti04is around 190 °C, which is actually similar to that of Inconel 718, i.e. 185 °C (the difference between δ solvus and solidus)[36]. The heat treatment window for Al02Ti03is 279 °C. Although the substitution of Ti by Al can decrease the γ′ solvus, the increase in solidus temperature can enlarge the heat treatment window, which will be beneficial for thermomechanical processing.","['fig4', 'fig1', 'fig4']","['tbl1', 'tbl1']"
3.2,Results and discussion.Thermal properties,"The size and volume fractions of γ′ precipitates after various ageing conditions from 750 °C to 900 °C for 50 h are shown inFig. 5, data of ageing temperatures below 750 °C are not listed since they are under-aged with γ′ size smaller than 10 nm. It appears that an increase in Al/Ti ratio can increase the size of γ′ and decrease its volume fraction. Furthermore, ageing at 800 °C and 900 °C can also increase the size of γ′ particles, and their volume fractions can be decreased as ageing temperatures are getting closer to γ′ solvus temperatures. On the other hand, higher Ti content renders higher volume fraction of γ′ and smaller size of γ′.",['fig5'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Hardness,"Fig. 6(a) presents the room temperature hardness values of samples subjected to different ageing temperatures, and the results suggest that 750 °C is the optimum temperature for precipitation strengthening. All alloys have become harder after aging heat treatments, and the peak hardness can be achieved by the 750 °C ageing; alloys become softer when aging temperatures are above 750 °C. The softening phenomenon can be attributed by a decrease in the volume fraction of γ′ as shown inFig. 5(b). Furthermore, the sharp drop in strength of Ti05can be a direct result of γ′ to η phase transformation at 900 °C, which has been prevented by Al substitutions in other alloys, hence hardness values of Al01Ti04and Al02Ti03can be higher than that of Ti05aged at 900 °C.","['fig6', 'fig5']",[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Hardness,"Hardness values from room temperature to 1000 °C are summarized inFig. 6(b); all alloys have been aged at 750 °C for 50 h before hardness tests. Interestingly, Ti05exhibits the highest hardness among all alloys. The unstable γ′ in Ti05can transform to brittle η at temperatures beyond 900 °C, however phase instability associated with η formation may not have much effect on the high temperature hardness tests due to short testing time. As Ti is being substituted by Al, the hardness of the alloy begins to drop. At room temperature, Al01Ti04and Inconel 718 have similar hardness values; Al01Ti04outperforms Inconel 718 at higher temperatures. Al02Ti03and Al03Ti02are softer than Inconel 718 up to 800 °C, interestingly, both of them outperform Inconel 718 at higher temperatures. The strengthening phase in Inconel 718 is γ′′, which can transform into detrimental δ phase at temperatures beyond 650 °C[37,38], so hardness of γ′ bearing Al02Ti03and Al03Ti02can surpass that of Inconel 718 at higher temperatures. Although 1000 °C is around the γ′ solvus temperatures of Al02Ti03and Al03Ti02, the high temperature hardness testing times are again too short to fully dissolve all γ′ into the matrix, hence γ′ particles can still be present to provide strengthening. By referring to the physical metallurgy of γ′ bearing superalloys[29,31,39,40], in addition to the core effects of high entropy alloys[41], the strength of these γ′ bearing HEA can be affected by properties of γ and γ′, including phase stability, anti-phase boundary energy (APB), stacking fault energy, lattice misfit and volume fraction of γ′. High temperature hardness tests in present study reflect mainly the contributions from the intrinsic strength of γ and γ′, and volume fraction of γ′. The changes in γ′ volume fractions agree with the high temperature hardness test results,Fig. 5(b) andFig. 6(b). According toTable 2, The compositions of γ and γ′ in high entropy alloys are highly alloyed comparing to those of conventional superalloys[42], furthermore, the high level of Ti content in γ′ can increase the APB energy significantly to hinder the movement of dislocations[39,43], hence Ti05and Al01Ti04can exhibit higher resistance against high temperature indentation comparing to Al02Ti03.","['fig6', 'fig5', 'fig6']",['tbl2']
3.3,Results and discussion.Hardness,"For long term structural application at elevated temperatures, phase stability can be one of the most critical requirements. Future work will investigate creep resistances of these alloys; high entropy alloys can possess low stacking fault energy[44]and sluggish diffusion[1], both can be beneficial for high temperature creep resistance. Future work will also include the construction of time-temperature-transformation diagrams for phase transformation in these high entropy alloys.",[],[]
3.4,Results and discussion.High temperature oxidation properties,"Fig. 7(a) presents the weight gain during isothermal oxidation tests at 900 °C for 200 h. Inconel 718 is a known chromia former[45], and has performed the best against oxidation comparing to other alloys in present study. The high entropy alloys can also exhibit certain degree of oxidation resistance with the formation of continuous chromia as shown inFig. 7(b); EDS mapping indicates the formation of a dense and continuous Cr2O3on the surface of Al02Ti03. The outermost oxides are iron oxide and titanium oxide mainly, and there are some internal oxidation of alumina beneath Cr2O3. The Al content can result in the “third element effect”[46]to increase the Cr activity and promote the formation of protective Cr2O3. However, sluggish diffusion may result delayed formation of continues chromia layer, and high Ti content can also induce the formation of TiO2attributing to an increase in weight gain initially. Nevertheless, once continuous layer of Cr2O3is formed, the oxidation can be hindered in high entropy alloys. In future alloy design, Cr and Al activity should be considered for more rapid formation of protective oxides.","['fig7', 'fig7']",[]
4,Conclusions,"The present study has investigated the effects of Al and Ti contents on the microstructures and high temperature properties of AlxCo1.5CrFeNi1.5Tiy(x, y values in molar ratio, x + y = 0.5) high entropy alloys. Al substitution to part of Ti can eliminate detrimental η and enhance the thermal stability of γ′. These alloys can have good hardness from room temperature to high temperatures. Furthermore, continuous Cr2O3can form to provide protection against high temperature oxidation. This work can serve as a guideline for future high entropy alloy design for high temperature applications.",[],[]
