0,Abstract,"The emergence of eutectic high-entropy alloys containing Laves phase provides a new and exciting research direction towards developing advanced structural alloys, in light of the inherent advantages of Laves phase at elevated temperatures. In this work, CoCrFeNiZrx alloys were prepared with varying zirconium contents by vacuum arc-melting method. Typical eutectic microstructure was identified in the as-cast alloy having x=0.5. The alloys consist of face-centered cubic solid solution and C15 Laves phase in the form of lamellae. Crystallographic orientation relationship between these two phases was determined. With the increase of the volume fraction of hard C15 Laves phase, the resulting alloys showed an increase in strength, but became more brittle at room temperature; the fracture process changed from ductile inter-lamellar fracture to brittle trans‑lamellar fracture. With the increase of test temperature, however, the fracture mode converted to be ductile fracture. As such, the eutectic microstructure can accommodate considerable plastic strain and has potential for engineering applications involving elevated temperatures.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-temperature structural alloys for the high-pressure turbine section of the engine are a major focus for increased efficiency and performance[1]. Alloy innovations will make a positive impact upon the development of high performance aircraft engines and other propulsion systems, leading to a spectacular decrease in fuel consumption and reduced environmental impact[2–3]. In the power generation sector, the demands for higher turbine efficiency are pushing fossil fuel-fired power plants to operate under ultra-supercritical conditions with steam temperature of up to 700–760°C and pressure of up to 35–37.5MPa[4–5]. The key to unleashing this technical potential lies in the availability of materials with excellent high temperature mechanical properties. Since currently used austenitic and ferritic steels are required to operate at temperature below 680°C, they cannot meet the new material demand for power generation[5]. As a result, traditional high-temperature structural alloys, such as Nimonic 263, Inconel 617 and Haynes 230, are being evaluated as the candidate materials. However, strong alloying effect often resulted in poor castability and compositional inhomogeneity in these alloys. It thus makes the alloy preparation both time- and energy- consuming.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs) are typically defined as alloys containing five or more elements with the composition of each element in the alloys ranging between 5 and 35at.%[6–7]. Due to their high strength and creep resistance at elevated temperatures, they are viewed as attractive high-temperature materials[8]. However, single-phased HEAs have been found to be difficult to overcome the strength-ductility trade-off[9]. Moreover, the poor castability and compositional segregation are commonly seen in HEAs, which further compromise their mechanical properties and hinder their engineering applications. The design of eutectic HEAs (EHEAs) makes the direct casting of advanced high-temperature alloys possible[10], rendering post-casting thermomechanical treatments redundant. Viewed as in-situ composites, the EHEAs have many unique characteristics, such as excellent phase stability, low-energy phase boundaries and a good balance of strength and ductility[11].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Laves phase is the largest group of intermetallic compounds. More than 1400 binary or ternary Laves phases have been reported[12–13]. Laves phases are attractive by serving as strengthening agents in structural materials due to their high strength and oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures[14–16]. The EHEAs strengthened by Laves phases have received much attention recently, since Laves phases can greatly enhance the mechanical properties of the HEAs at both room and elevated temperatures. As noted in most of the EHEAs is C14 Laves phase[17–19]. In fact, Laves phase can be characterized by one of three structures; namely, C14 (MgZn2type), C15 (MgCu2type) and C36 (MgNi2type). It has been found that heat treatment at elevated temperatures over extended periods of time could lead to the sluggish transformation from the C14 structure to either the C36 or C15 structure[20]. In view of this, the study of EHEAs strengthened by C15 or C36 Laves phase is important to determining the high temperature applications of the EHEAs strengthened by Laves phases. Unfortunately, there is limited information about the microstructure and mechanical properties of the EHEAs strengthened by the C15 or C36 Laves phase, especially at elevated temperatures.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The motivation in the development of CoCrFeNiZrxEHEAs can therefore be described as follows: firstly, eutectic structure could be formed between the element pairs of zirconium‑cobalt[21], zirconium‑chromium[22], zirconium‑iron[23]and zirconium‑nickel[24]. Secondly, zirconium is known to be a key element to form the Laves phase, and Co2Zr[25], Cr2Zr[26], Fe2Zr[27]Laves phases all could have C15 structure. In addition, elements used in CoCrFeNiZrxEHEAs have ideal melting points, and as such the alloys have the potential to be applied in high-temperature environments. Moreover, the use of zirconium to replace niobium can reduce the alloy density. Last but not least, zirconium was selected because it is a getter element that has the ability to collect free gases, such as H, for nuclear applications. In this work, we developed CoCrFeNiZrxEHEAs, using vacuum arc-melting method. The microstructure and mechanical properties of the EHEAs were examined and ascertained. In particular, the orientation relationship between C15 Laves phase and FCC solid solution was clarified.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The CoCrFeNiZrx(x=0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5) HEAs were produced by arc melting of high-purity elements (Co≥99.95, Cr≥99.99, Fe≥99.99, Ni≥99.99, Zr≥99.99wt%) in a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere. The ingots were flipped and re-melted five times to ensure the alloy was mixed well in the liquid state. The crystal structure of the resulting alloys was identified by a Bruker D8 Discover X-ray diffraction (XRD) with CuKα radiation, operating at a voltage of 40kV and a current of 30mA. The alloy microstructure was examined by an FEI Quanta 3D FEG DualBeam field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) operating at 25kV in backscattered electron (BSE) mode, as well as an FEI Tecnai G2 transmission electron microscope (TEM) capable of energy disperse spectroscopy (EDS). The thin foil samples for TEM observation were cut from the EHEAs. The sections were firstly mechanically polished, and then ion-beam thinned inside a cold station at 100K.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The hardness of the new alloys was measured under a 500g load held for 10s (FM-700 automatic micro-hardness tester). Nanoindentation experiments were conducted on MML Nano Test Vantage equipped with a Berkovich indenter at a temperature of 20°C. Three tests were carried out for each case to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. The loading rate was fixed to 5mN/s. The tests were carried out until the thermal drift was reduced to <0.05nm/s. The drift correction was conducted at 10% of the maximum load during the unloading process. Tensile tests were carried out on dog bone-shaped tensile samples using an MTS CMT 5105 materials testing machine at a strain rate of 1×10−3s−1at three different temperatures; namely, room temperature (RT), 923K and 1023K. The dog bone-shaped tensile samples had a gauge length of 8mm, a width of 1mm and a thickness of 0.5mm. The percent elongation (i.e., ductility) was measured by measuring the length of the tensile samples before and after tensile testing. Three samples were tested in each case to ensure the reproducibility of the results. After tests, the morphologies of fracture surfaces were examined by an FEI Sirion FE-SEM.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Crystal structure,"The XRD patterns of CoCrFeNiZrxEHEAs are shown in Fig. 1 a. According to the JCPDS cards (47-1417 and 36-1095), two phases, i.e., FCC solid solution and C15 Laves phase, were detected in the CoCrFeNiZrxEHEAs. The lattice parameters of FCC solid solution and Laves phase are shown in Fig. 1 b. With increasing x value, the lattice parameters of both FCC solid solution and Laves phase increase.","['f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3.2,Results.Microstructure," Fig. 2 shows the microstructures obtained under BSE mode. The hypoeutectic microstructures were observed in CoCrFeNiZr0.1, CoCrFeNiZr0.2, CoCrFeNiZr0.3and CoCrFeNiZr0.4alloys, while the eutectic structure was obtained in CoCrFeNiZr0.5alloy. For hypoeutectic CoCrFeNiZrx, the volume fraction of eutectic structures increased with the increase of x value. During the eutectic reaction, Laves phase and FCC solid solution grew in parallel with each other to form fine coupled lamellae. The resulting eutectic alloy consists of the alternating layers of FCC solid solution and Laves phase. For hypoeutectic alloys, the microstructures are composed of primary FCC solid solution and the eutectic colonies. As seen in Fig. 3 , the eutectic microstructures of the EHEAs are identified in the alloys (x=0.1–0.5). Fig. 3 g shows the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns of ‘A’ in the EHEA ( Fig. 3 f). There are multiple stacking faults and twins in the C15 Laves phase, which is in agreement with previous reports[20,28]. The EDS results are presented in Table 1 .","['f0010', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']",['t0005']
3.3,Results.Mechanical properties," Fig. 4 shows the hardness of the EHEAs. Interestingly, the hardness shows an approximately parabolic increase with increasing volume fraction of Laves phase. Roughly, it can be expressed as yHV=0.07958x2+178.3, where yHVis the hardness value, and x is the volume fraction of Laves phase (vol%). It is understood that the hardness increased, as a result of the increase of the volume fraction of hard Laves phase. Fig. 5 ashows the load-displacement curves of FCC solid solution (in CoCrFeNiZr0.1) and eutectic structure (in CoCrFeNiZr0.5). The indentation depth generated on the eutectic structure is shallower than that on the FCC solid solution. The values of measured hardness and elastic modulus are presented in Table 2 .","['f0020', 'f0025']",['t0010']
3.3,Results.Mechanical properties," Fig. 6 ashows the stress-strain curves of the EHEAs (x=0.1–0.4) obtained at the RT. The CoCrFeNiZr0.5EHEA is too brittle to have the samples prepared for tensile testing. The ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation to failure of the alloys are shown in Fig. 6 b. With increasing x value of CoCrFeNiZrx, the UTS increases, while the ductility decreases. As such, the CoCrFeNiZr0.4alloy has the highest UTS, 667MPa, while the CoCrFeNiZr0.1alloy has the best ductility, 11.0% among all samples tested. Fig. 7 ashows the stress-strain curves of CoCrFeNiZr0.4alloys obtained with increasing temperature. As shown in Fig. 7 b, the alloy shows the better ductility with increasing temperature. The fracture surfaces of the alloys are shown in Fig. 8 . With the increase of the volume fraction of hard C15 Laves phase, the fracture mode of the alloys changed from ductile inter-lamellar fracture to brittle trans‑lamellar fracture while being tested at the RT. With the increase of temperature, the fracture mode of the CoCrFeNiZr0.4alloy changes to be ductile fracture.","['f0030', 'f0030', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0040']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation,"∆Hmix(mixing enthalpy),δ(atomic size difference), ∆Smix(mixing entropy) and parameterΩhave been proposed by Zhang et al.[29–30]to predict the phase formation and structural stability in HEAs. They are expressed below,(1)∆Hmix=∑i=1i≠jnΩijcicj=4∑i=1i≠jn∆Hijmixcicj(2)δ=∑i=1nci1−rir−2(3)∆Smix=−R∑i=1ncilnci(4)Ω=Tm∆Smix∆Hmix,whereciis the atomic percent of theith element, ∆Hijmixis the mixing enthalpy between theith andjth elements,riis the Goldschmidt atomic size of theith element, R is the gas constant and equivalent to 8.314JK−1·mol−1andTm=∑i=1nciTmiis the average value of the melting temperature. The values of ∆HmixABcan be calculated by using the Miedema model[31]for atomic pairs ( Table 3 ). Table 3 also shows the atomic sizes[32]. ∆Hmix,δ, ∆SmixandΩwere calculated and are shown in Table 4 . Interestingly, CoCrFeNiZr0.3, CoCrFeNiZr0.4and CoCrFeNiZr0.5alloys meet the criteria for formation of intermetallics, while CoCrFeNiZr0.1and CoCrFeNiZr0.2alloys satisfy the rules for development of solid solutions[29–30]. In fact, all of CoCrFeNiZrxalloys in this work have a dual-phase structure. It is worth noting that the enthalpies of formation of the lowest energy structures of binary compounds relative to phase separation into pure elements have been suggested by Troparevsky et al.[33–34]. The enthalpies are evaluated by first-principles ‘high-throughput’ density functional theory calculations of the formation energies of binary compounds in HEA systems. Table 5 presents the calculated enthalpies[33]in the HEA system. Some ΔΗfvalues of the binary components are beyond the recommended boundaries for single solid solution formation (−138<ΔΗf<37meV/mol). In this case, possible phase segregation phenomena would be expected. Therefore, for the HEAs that meet the criteria, ∆Hmix-δandΩ-δ, the possibility of forming intermetallic compounds still cannot be ignored. In the view of this, the criteria, ΔΗf, is more suitable for analyzing this alloy system.",[],"['t0015', 't0015', 't0020', 't0025']"
4.2,Discussion.Crystallographic orientation relationship,"The SAED patterns in Fig. 3 g reveal the following preferred crystallographic interface orientation between the C15 Laves phase and FCC solid solution in the EHEA,(5)111Laves phase//111FCC(6)01−1Laves phase//−211FCC",['f0015'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Crystallographic orientation relationship,"Based on the SAED patterns, the interplanar spacings were determined for the (111) plane of both Laves phase and FCC solid solution, which are ~2.10 and 4.05Å, respectively. It shows that the (111) plane spacing of FCC solid solution is about twice that of Laves phase. At the interface between (111) plane of Laves phase and (222) plane of FCC solid solution, the absolute value |δ| of the misfit[35]can be calculated as:(7)δ=2dLaves phase−dFCCdLaves phase+dFCC",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Crystallographic orientation relationship,"This gives δ=0.036. In fact, the resulting microstructure is typical of binary eutectic crystallization from a melt, which requires cooperative nucleation and growth of Laves phase and FCC solid solution. Lamellar eutectics could minimize the interface energy by maximizing the area of low-energy facets[35]. This helps explain the presence of the above orientation relationship.",[],[]
4.3,Discussion.Relationship between microstructures and mechanical properties,"Interestingly, for the EHEAs with the lower volume fraction of C15 Laves phase, there are tearing ridges in the fracture surface in Fig. 8 . It indicates that the fracture mechanism is ductile inter-lamellar fracture. In addition, microcracks are observed in the Laves phase lamellas. With increasing volume fraction of C15 Laves phase, tearing ridges gradually disappeared, while microcracks became more dominant, meaning that the brittleness of the alloys increased. This is consistent with the observed behavior of the stress-strain curves. The deformability of C15 Laves phase was limited and controlled by microcracking under strains[36]. With the increase of temperature, the fracture mode of CoCrFeNiZr0.4alloy changes to be ductile fracture. Therefore, the EHEAs have potential for load-carrying applications at elevated temperatures. In the EHEAs, the composite structure of the hard Laves phase embedded within the ductile FCC solid solution makes it possible to estimate the material strength according to the rule-of-mixtures prediction[37],(8)σEHEA=VLaves phaseσLaves phase+1−VLaves phaseσFCC,where an isostrain assumption is made,VLaves phaseis the volume fraction of Laves phase,σLaves phaseis the stress of Laves phase under a specific value of strain, andσFCCis the stress of FCC solid solution under the same strain. Eq.(8)reveals a significant strengthening effect imparted to the EHEAs by the C15 Laves phase. However, the large volume fraction of Laves phase is bound to make the alloys hard but brittle at the RT. At elevated temperatures, the alloys show improved ductility. As shown in Fig. 1 b, the presence of zirconium atoms in the FCC solid solution increased the lattice distortion significantly in the CoCrFeNiZr0.4alloy. The tensile strength at high temperatures is attributed to a combination of the second-phase hardening from the C15 Laves phase and the solid-solution strengthening from the zirconium atoms. More importantly, the eutectic microstructure can accommodate considerable plastic strain at elevated temperatures. For the CoCrFeNiZr0.4alloy the remarkable ductility at elevated temperatures is provided by both FCC solid-solution and C15 Laves phase. It suggests that the CoCrFeNiZrxEHEAs have potential for applications as high-temperature structural alloys. However, the strength-ductility trade-off remains in this alloy system and should be considered in high-temperature applications.","['f0040', 'fo0040', 'f0005']",[]
5,Conclusions,"In this work, CoCrFeNiZrxeutectic high-entropy alloys were prepared by vacuum arc-melting method. The typical eutectic microstructure was obtained in the CoCrFeNiZr0.5alloy, while the hypoeutectic structures were identified in other compositions. The eutectic structure consists of FCC solid solution coupled with C15 Laves phases that forms a lamellar organization. Crystallographic orientation relationship between the two phases is identified as (111)Laves phase//(111)FCCand [01-1]Laves phase//[-211]FCC. With increasing volume fraction of C15 Laves phase, the alloys showed enhanced strengths, but became more brittle, and the fracture mode changed from ductile inter-lamellar fracture to brittle trans‑lamellar fracture. With the increase of temperature, the fracture mode of the CoCrFeNiZr0.4alloy changes to be ductile fracture. Therefore, the CoCrFeNiZrxEHEAs have potential for applications at high-temperatures.",[],[]
