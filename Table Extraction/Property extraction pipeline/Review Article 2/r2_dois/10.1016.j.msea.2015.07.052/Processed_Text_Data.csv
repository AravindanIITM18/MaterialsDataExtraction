0,Abstract,"A novel equiatomic Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20 (at%) alloy was designed and synthesized to study the effect of high atomic concentrations of Al and Ti elements on the microstructure, phase composition and mechanical behavior of high-entropy alloys (HEAs) fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) and spark plasma sintering (SPS). Following the MA process, the Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20 alloy was composed of a primary body-centered cubic (BCC) supersaturated solid solution and a face-centered cubic (FCC) supersaturated solid solution. However, following SPS, a primary FCC solid-solution phase, a BCC solid-solution phase and a trace amount of Al3Ti intermetallics were observed. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results confirmed the presence of the FCC solid-solution phase, the BCC (B2-type) solid-solution phase and Al3Ti intermetallics in the bulk alloy. The FCC and B2-type phases are ultrafine-grained, and Al3Ti intermetallics is nano/ultrafine-grained. Our results suggest that consideration of a single existing empirical design criterion is inadequate to explain phase formation in the Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20 alloy. Solid-solution strengthening, grain-boundary strengthening, twin-boundary strengthening, the presence of the strong B2-type BCC phase, and precipitate strengthening due to the presence of a trace amount of Al3Ti are responsible for the ultra-high compressive strength of ~2988MPa and hardness of ~704Hv. The strain-to-failure of ~5.8% with visible ductility is dominated by the FCC solid-solution phase.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Traditional alloy systems are based on one or two principal metallic element with small concentrations of additional elements added to tailor microstructures and properties, which inherently limits the number of alloy systems achievable due to the limited number of metallic elements in the periodic table. More recently, a novel alloy design strategy involving the concept of multiple principal elements with equal or nearly equal molar fractions of component elements, has been proposed and the resulting materials have been termed high-entropy alloys (HEAs)[1]. Each constituent element with a concentration between 5 and 35at% is considered as a principal element, and the presence of five or more principal elements results in the fact that “solvent” or “solute” atoms are not distinct[1]. A high entropy decreases the Gibbs free energy of mixing,ΔGmix, in HEA systems especially at elevated temperatures based on the equationΔGmix=ΔHmix−TΔSmix[1–3]. As a result, unexpectedly stable body- or/and face-centered cubic (BCC or/and FCC) or even hexagonal close-packed (HCP) solid-solutions are formed[1,3,4].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"HEAs can attain expectedly high solid-solution strengthening derived from the multiple-principal elements which create strong lattice distortion and therefore high strength and hardness are achievable in this novel class of alloys[1,3]. Elements possessing larger atomic radii compared to other component elements, such as Al and Ti, are usually introduced into HEA systems as a strategy to increase the effect of solid-solution strengthening[5–9]. However, Al and Ti have good affinity with a variety of elements that are usually used in HEA systems, and accordingly high atomic concentrations of them results in intermetallics and/or other complex phases, further downgrading ductility and comprehensive mechanical properties[8–10]. Inspection of the literature reveals that few investigations have focused on the HEA systems exhibiting high atomic concentrations of Al and Ti. However, introducing a small amount of intermetallics into metals or alloys would facilitate a reasonable reinforced strength[11,12]. Additionally, previous studies have shown that equiatomic FCC structured CoNiFe alloy has good ductility[13,14]. Hence, on the basis of the arguments described above, we designed a novel equiatomic Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20(CoNiFeAlTi) alloy, to involve a slightly higher concentrations of both Al and Ti into the equiatomic CoNiFe alloy, with the aim of obtaining high solid-solution strengthening and a small amount of intermetallic phases.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Inspection of the available literature reveals that casting and mechanical alloying (MA) followed by sintering are the two most common processing routes for bulk HEAs[3,15]. The Refs.[15,16]show that typical defects of casting processes, such as phase segregation and inhomogeneous microstructures, result in degradation of the mechanical properties of HEAs. The combination of MA and sintering exhibit better homogeneity of microstructure compared to that of casting and can avoid the potential segregation and inhomogeneous microstructures in HEAs[17,18]. Furthermore, spark plasma sintering (SPS) can consolidate powders within short sintering time, thereby achieving ultra-fine or even nanocrystalline grain sizes in the bulk alloys after consolidation[19,20].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Thus, in view of the above discussion, we designed a novel Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy in this study to provide insight into the effect of high atomic concentrations of Al and Ti elements on the alloying behavior, phase composition and evolution, microstructure and mechanical properties of HEAs. The Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy was fabricatedviamechanical alloying followed by spark plasma sintering.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy powders were processed by mechanical alloying of elemental powders of Co, Ni, Fe, Al and Ti with particle sizes of ≤45µm (−325 mesh) in a high-energy planetary ball mill using the following procedure. First, elemental powders of greater than 99.7wt% purity were placed in stainless steel vials with tungsten carbide balls, without a process control agent (PCA). A ball-to-powder weight ratio of 10:1 and a high-purity argon atmosphere were applied during the whole MA process. Then, the powders were subjected to 4h wet milling with high-purity ethanol as a PCA, followed after by 45h of dry milling at 300rpm. Before analysis and sintering, the ethanol was removed by drying via evaporation in a vacuum oven for a minimum of 24h. Bulk samples were prepared by SPS of the dried Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy powders followed by passing through a 75mm sieve, using a Dr. Sinter 825 apparatus (Sumitomo Coal Mining Co. Ltd., Japan). SPS was conducted at 1273K for 8min with a heating rate of ~90Kmin−1. During the entire SPS process, a constant pressure of 30MPa was applied while maintaining a vacuum pressure <8Pa. Specimens used for the subsequent testing were sectioned from the sintered bulk samples by electrical discharge machining.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"X-ray diffraction (XRD) studies of the powders and bulk samples were performed on a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation. A NETZSCH STA 449C differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) was used to perform the thermal analysis under a high purity Ar atmosphere, by performing from room temperature to 1323K with a heating rate of 10Kmin−1. Phase composition of each bulk sample and their detailed chemical compositions were carried out by a transmission electron microscope (TEM) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED), performed on a JEOL JEM-2100 (Tokyo, Japan) operated at 200KV with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS). Specimens for TEM observations were prepared by mechanical thinning followed by ion milling at ambient temperature. Uniaxial compression tests of cylindrical specimens with the dimensions ofØ3mm×4.5mm were performed at ambient temperature in an Instron 5500 testing system at an engineering strain rate of 1×10−3s−1. Three nominally identical specimens of each sample were compressed to obtain average value. Vickers hardness of bulk samples were measured at minimum of 10 measurements for each specimen with a HVS-1000 digital micro-hardness tester with a load of 2942mN.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Alloying behavior,"The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the mechanically alloyed (MA'ed) powders of the Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy with different milling times are presented in Fig. 1(a) . Peaks corresponding to elemental Co, Ni, Fe, Al and Ti are evident in the XRD pattern before milling. After 6h of milling, diffraction peaks associated with most component elements exhibit dramatic decreases in intensity. As milling time increases to 15h, diffraction peaks corresponding to Ni, Fe, and Ti are still observed, whereas those corresponding to Al and Co are absent, indicating that Al and Co have been dissolved. After 30h of milling, no elemental components can be identified, and peaks corresponding to both BCC and FCC solid-solution phases are evident, with the BCC phase being the main phase. The alloying rates of the component elements are inversely correlated with their melting points and ductility. It ascribes an element having a lower melting point exhibiting a higher intrinsic diffusion coefficient in comparison with that having a higher melting point[17,21]. On the other hand, a brittle element could be crushed more easily than a ductile element when they have similar melting points, therefore resulting in acceleration of alloying rate[21]. Accordingly the anticipated alloying rates in the equiatomic Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy is: Al→Co→Ni→Fe→Ti, which is consistent with the observations in previous studies[17,21]. Further milling after 30h was performed to ensure complete formation of a solid-solution and to refine its grain size. Moreover, 4h of wet milling was carried out after 45h of dry milling to achieve smaller sizes of powder particles, which facilitate the subsequent sintering of the powders. The XRD patterns of the 45h and 49h milled powders are similar to that of the 30h powders, however, peaks are broadened, attributable to grain refinement and an increment in lattice strain[17]. Fig. 1(b)  displays the pattern of a slow san of the 49h milled powders in the range of 2θ=40–48°, and the fitting result verifies that the asymmetrically overlapped peak contains two peaks corresponding to a main BCC solid-solution phase and an FCC solid-solution phase, respectively.","['f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3.2,"Results and discussion.Microstructure, phase composition and evolution","The XRD pattern of the bulk alloy after SPS is presented in Fig. 2(a)  with that of the 49h milled powders for comparison. The bulk alloy consists of a primary FCC solid-solution phase, a BCC solid-solution phase and a trace amount of Al3Ti intermetallic phase. In contrast, the primary phase is the BCC solid-solution phase and there is no Al3Ti intermetallic phase in the 49h milled powders. These observations reveal phase transformation during SPS. A differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve of the 49h milled powders in a temperature range of room temperature to 1323K is shown in Fig. 2(b) . Two endothermic peaks at ~724.85K and ~1062.75K are visible, suggesting that phase transformations may occur at these two temperatures. Based on the endothermic peaks in Fig. 2(a)  and (b), it is postulated that the energy absorption at ~724.85K is attributable to the phase formation of Al3Ti, and that at ~1062.75K corresponds to a phase evolution that results in the change in volume fractions of the FCC and BCC phases. Because of the solubility extension generated during the non-equilibrium MA process[22], supersaturated solid-solutions are formed in the milled powders, which consist of a primary BCC phase and an FCC phase. These metastable supersaturated solid-solution phases transform to equilibrium phases during sintering or heating, leading to the above-mentioned phase evolution. The excessive amount of energy stored in the milled powders in the form of grain boundaries with significant volume fraction and dislocations with high density may reduce the activation energy for phase evolution and accordingly facilitate its occurrence during sintering or heating[17,22].","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010']",[]
3.2,"Results and discussion.Microstructure, phase composition and evolution"," Fig. 3(a)  shows a bright-field transmission electron microscope (TEM) image of the bulk Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20HEA after SPS at 1273K for 8min. The selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern of grain A is presented in Fig. 3(b) , corresponding to that of an FCC structure along [011] zone axis. Similarly, the SAED pattern of grain B is displayed in Fig. 3(c) , corresponding to that of an ordered BCC structure (B2-type structure) along [001] zone axis. In addition, the arrows in Fig. 3(a)  indicate Al3Ti intermetallics, which are also confirmed by chemical composition analysis using EDS/TEM as listed in Table 1 , i.e., ~71.03±1.38 (Al), 23.13±1.27 (Ti), 2.30±0.72 (Fe), 2.24±0.66 (Co) and 1.30±0.57 (Ni) at%. As shown in Table 1 , the chemical composition of the FCC phase obtained by EDS/TEM is ~5.39±0.61 (Al), 8.92±0.73 (Ti), 31.69±0.90 (Fe), 26.85±0.34 (Ni) and 27.15±1.41 (Co) at%. In contrast, the chemical composition of the B2-type BCC phase is ~19.98±0.27 (Al), 17.37±2.56 (Ti), 12.31±3.22 (Fe), 25.71±0.42 (Ni) and 24.63±0.62 (Co) at%. That is, the FCC phase is a Ni–Co–Fe-based solid-solution with some Al and Ti present, whereas the B2-type BCC phase is a Ni–Co–Al–Ti-based solid-solution with some Fe present. This result is consistent with previous reports that higher Al and Ti contents are favorable to formation of BCC phases, and lower Al and Ti contents benefit formation of FCC phases in HEAs[3,15]. In addition, ordered BCC phases, i.e., B2-type BCC phases, are observed in many Al- and Ti-containing HEAs because of Al and Ti displaying strong bonding with 3d transition metals, such as Cr, Fe, Ni, Co, etc.[6,8,15]. It is obvious that the FCC and B2-type BCC phases are ultra-fine in grain size, and Al3Ti intermetallic phase is nanocrystalline or ultra-fine in grain size.","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']","['t0005', 't0005']"

Fig. 4(b)  shows the SAED pattern of grain C along [011]M(matrix) and [01¯1¯]T(twin) zone axes, confirming the presence of twins.

3.2,"Results and discussion.Microstructure, phase composition and evolution","Due to the lack of complete phase diagrams, it is challenging to design HEAs with desirable phases, microstructures and properties, resulting in many attempts to develop empirical design criteria by analyzing the available data on HEA systems. Although the available empirical criteria for HEAs are not very accurate, researchers have relied heavily on them to design HEAs, and in particular, the criterion proposed by Yang et al. has been applied in many HEAs[25]. In early studies, Zhang et al. proposed a criterion for solid-solution formation in HEAs, that is, atomic radius differences (δ), enthalpy of mixing (ΔHmix) and entropy of mixing (ΔSmix) should meet the following conditions simultaneously[26]:ΔSmix>13.38JK−1mol−1,δ<4.6% and −2.685δ−2.54<ΔHmix<−1.28δ+5.44KJmol−1. The parametersδ,ΔHmixandΔSmixare defined as follows[25,26],(1)δ=∑i=1nci(1−ri/r¯)2,r¯=∑i=1nciri(2)ΔHmix=∑i=1,i≠jnΩijcicj=∑i=1,i≠jn4Hijmixcicj(3)ΔSmix=−R∑i=1n(cilnci)Where∑i=1nci=1,riis the atomic radius of theithcomponent.ciandcjare the atomic concentrations of theithandjthcomponents, respectively.Ris the gas constant equal to 8.314JK−1mol−1; andHijmixrepresents the enthalpy of mixing theithandjthcomponents, which are from the calculations on the basis of Miedema macroscopic model for ideal binary liquid alloys[25,27]. Subsequently, this criterion was amended as follows[28]: 12<ΔSmix<17.5JK−1mol−1,δ<6.4% and −20<ΔHmix<5KJmol−1. In addition, a less restrictive criterion, i.e., 11≤ΔSmix≤19.5JK−1mol−1,δ≤8.5%, −22≤ΔHmix≤7KJmol−1, was proposed by Guo et al.[29]. However, it is challenging to determine the threshold values of these parameters.",[],[]
3.2,"Results and discussion.Microstructure, phase composition and evolution","In subsequent work, Yang et al. proposed that solid-solutions are formed when satisfying simultaneously the conditions ofΩ=TmΔSmix|ΔHmix|≥1.1 (Tmis the mole averaged melting point) andδ≤6.6%[25]. Recently, another criterionγ=ωSmallωLarge<1.175, was proposed by Wang et al. for the formation of solid-solutions in HEAs[30].ωSmallandωLargeindicate the solid angles around the smallest and largest atoms, described as follows[30],(4)ωSmall=1−(rLarge+r¯)2+r¯2(rLarge+r¯)2,ωLarge=1−(rSmall+r¯)2+r¯2(rSmall+r¯)2HererSmallandrLargeare the atomic radii of the smallest and largest component atoms. In addition, average valence electron concentrationVEC=∑i=1nci(VEC)i, whereciand(VEC)iare the mole fraction and valence electron concentration of theithelement, respectively, is regarded as a useful parameter for predicting the crystal structures of solid-solution phases in HEAs[29,31]. According to the proposition of Guo et al., single FCC or single BCC solid-solution phases would be formed whenVEC≥8 orVEC<6.87, respectively, and when 6.87≤VEC<8, both FCC and BCC solid-solution phases would be formed[31].",[],[]
3.2,"Results and discussion.Microstructure, phase composition and evolution","According to the results presented above, the bulk Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy after SPS consists of a primary FCC solid-solution phase, a B2-type BCC solid-solution phase and a trace amount of Al3Ti. As given in Table 2 , the estimated values ofΔHmix,ΔSmix,δ,Ω,VECandγfor the Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy are −26.40KJmol−1, 13.38 JK−1mol−1, 6.85%, 0.83, 6.8 and 1.018, respectively. For this alloy, the entropy of mixingΔSmix=13.38JK−1mol−1is high, facilitating the formation of solid-solutions[28,29]. Also the value ofγis 1.108<1.175 for the Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy, which satisfies the criterion proposed by Wang et al. for formation of solid-solution phases in HEAs[30]. However, a trace amount of Al3Ti was identified in the bulk Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy in addition to the two solid-solution phases, indicating that these two empirical criteria involving the parameters ofΔSmixandγdo not apply to this alloy. In addition, the values ofδandΩfor this alloy are 6.85% and 0.83, respectively, which do not satisfy the conditions ofΩ≥1.1 andδ≤6.6% proposed by Yang et al. for formation of solid-solution phases in HEAs[25]. According to the criterion of Yang et al., intermetallics or other complicated phases are anticipated to be formed in the Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy, which is consistent with our experimental results. Therefore, this criterion applies to the Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy. Furthermore, the value ofVECis 6.8 for the Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy, very close to the threshold value of 6.87 for the formation of a single BCC solid-solution phase (VEC<6.87) or a mixture of BCC+FCC solid-solution phases (6.87≤VEC<8)[31]. One can assume that forVECvalues close to the threshold value, the formation of single BCC solid-solution phase or the formation of BCC+FCC solid-solution phases are both possible, since the threshold value of 6.87 may not be accurate or may be different for different alloys. Evidently, the consideration of a single existing empirical design criterion is not adequate for predicting or explaining phase formation in the Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy prepared by MA and SPS. To achieve more adequate predication of formation of solid-solution phases in HEAs, all of the existing criteria should be considered.",[],['t0010']
3.2,"Results and discussion.Microstructure, phase composition and evolution"," Table 3 shows atomic radii and enthalpy of mixing in binary equiatomic alloys calculated by Miedema's approach[27,29]. Ni, Co and Fe have similar atomic radii and electronegativity, which is in favor of formation of solid solutions[27,29,32]. Therefore, the formation of an FCC solid-solution phase enriched in Ni–Co–Fe is anticipated, consistent with previous studies[13,14]. Al and Ti exhibit a significantly negative enthalpy of mixing (−30kJmol−1) and possess larger atomic radii than Fe, Ni and Co, and thus affinity is more preferred between these two elements. Moreover, the enthalpies of mixing for different atom-pairs among Al, Ti, Co and Ni are significantly negative ranging from −19 to −35KJmol−1. In particular, Ti and Ni have the most negative enthalpy of mixing of −35KJmol−1[27,32]. It appears that these elements have similar affinity leading to similar ability to attract each other, that is, a trend of “mixing” which is referred to as “mixing entropy effect” or “high entropy effect”[1,15], and accordingly resulting in the formation of the B2-type BCC solid-solution phase enriched in Ni–Co–Al–Ti. Additionally, besides the formation of FCC and BCC solid-solution phases, residual Al and Ti formed a trace amount of Al3Ti intermetallics, because of their good affinity mentioned above.",[],['t0015']
3.3,Results and discussion.Mechanical behavior," Fig. 5 displays the engineering stress–strain curve of the bulk Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy under compression at room temperature. The bulk Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy exhibits an ultra-high compressive strength (σmax) of ~2988MPa, an ultra-high hardness of ~704Hv and a strain-to-failure (εf) of ~5.8%, respectively. Table 4 summarizes mechanical properties of the SPS’ed Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy and some typical SPS’ed HEAs at room temperature. Note that values ofεffor some alloys were re-estimated according to their engineering stress–strain curves under compression at room temperature, which is attributed to incorrectly elastic deformation behaviors in these HEAs. It is obvious that the SPS’ed Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy exhibits the highest compressive strength among the typical SPS’ed HEAs given in Table 4 . In HEA systems, B2-type BCC phases exhibits significantly higher strength and less ductility in comparison with FCC structured phases[3,15]. Hence, the B2-type BCC contributes to strengthening the bulk alloy while the FCC phase primarily contributes to ductility. Although Al3Ti is formed after SPS, the engineering stress–strain curve of the bulk alloy shows a visible stage of plasticity originating from the primary FCC solid-solution phase[15], and its plasticity is comparable with some typical SPS’ed HEAs as given in  Table 4 [7,17,33,36–39], Co0.5NiFeCrTi0.5, CoCrFeNiAl, AlFeNiCoCrMn, for example. This is attributed to the bulk Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy possessing a mostly ductile FCC phase, and low volume fractions of B2-type BCC phase and Al3Ti intermetallics. Therefore, the ultra-high strength and hardness are dominantly attributed to solid-solution strengthening caused by Al and Ti with larger atomic radii than Fe, Ni and Co[3,17], the presence of the strong B2-type BCC phase[3,15], grain-boundary strengthening resulting from the ultra-fine FCC and B2-type BCC grains[34,35], and twin-boundary strengthening originating from nanoscale twins[35], as well as precipitate strengthening due to the presence of a trace amount of nanocrystalline or ultra-fine Al3Ti precipitates[11,34,35].",['f0025'],"['t0020', 't0020']"
4,Conclusions,"Bulk Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy was fabricated by MA and SPS. After MA, a primary BCC solid-solution phase and an FCC solid-solution phase were formed. In contrast, a primary FCC solid-solution phase with a BCC solid-solution phase and a trace amount of Al3Ti intermetallic phase was formed after SPS. TEM results of the bulk Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy confirmed the FCC, BCC (B2-type) and Al3Ti phases. The FCC and B2-type BCC phases were ultra-fine in size, whereas Al3Ti intermetallic phase was nanocrystalline or ultra-fine in size. The compressive strength, strain-to-failure and hardness of the bulk Co20Ni20Fe20Al20Ti20alloy are ~2988MPa, 5.8% and 704Hv, respectively. Ultra-high strength and hardness are attributed to the presence of strong B2-type BCC phase, solid-solution strengthening, grain-boundary strengthening, twin-boundary strengthening, and precipitate strengthening due to the presence of a trace amount of Al3Ti intermetallic phase.",[],[]
