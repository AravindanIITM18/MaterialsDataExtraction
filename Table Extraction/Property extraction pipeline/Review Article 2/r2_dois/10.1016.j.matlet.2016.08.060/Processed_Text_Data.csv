0,Abstract,"The HfNbTaTiZr refractory high-entropy alloy was investigated on the grain growth kinetics and tensile properties. Grain growth at 1200–1350°C is rather slow. The activation energy is 389kJ/mol and the growth exponent is 3.5. The HfNbTaTiZr alloy has high strength, small work hardening and high ductility. Grain refining is found to enhance the tensile strength and ductility simultaneously.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"A new alloy design strategy called high-entropy alloys (HEAs) has attracted significant attention in the past decade[1–4]. A subclass of HEAs, the refractory HEAs, is also of great interest[5,6]. These alloys can have exceptional high-temperature strength and reasonable compressive plasticity. However, their tensile ductility at room temperature is a major concern. In this regard, the HfNbTaTiZr alloy is special because it has a very high compressive plasticity (ε>50%) at room temperature. Grain refining is considered as a route to improve the mechanical properties of metals and alloys[7]. Some literatures on CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy with single FCC phase had revealed the grain growth mechanism and the grain size effect on mechanical properties[8,9], and the grain refining effectively strengthens this alloy. However, it is rare to see the literature reporting the grain growth kinetics and grain refining effect on the HfNbTaTiZr equiatomic alloy with single BCC phase yet. The understanding of these two aspects is important especially in controlling grain structure and tensile properties for structural applications. Therefore, the present study is focusing on the grain growth kinetics and the grain-size dependence of tensile properties of HfNbTaTiZr alloy.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The HfNbTaTiZr HEA was prepared by vacuum-arc-melting of high-purity elements (99.9wt%). Melting was repeated for at least five times to improve the chemical homogeneity of the alloy. The ingots were cold-rolled by a reduction of 70%, then sealed in a vacuum quartz tube and heat-treated in an air furnace at 1200, 1250, 1300 and 1350°C for different time. The samples were examined by an optical microscope (OM). The grain size was measured from micrographs by using the linear-intercept method. At least 100 grain boundaries were intercepted for the calculation. Crystal structures of the alloys were examined with an X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu XRD-6000). The tensile-test samples had the dog-bone shape with the gage-section dimensions of 2×3×20mm. Tensile tests were performed at an initial strain rate of 10−3by Instron 4468universal testing machine. An Instron extensometer was used to record the strain of each specimen during tensile test. At least two specimens were tested for each heat-treatment condition to confirm the reliable data.",[],[]
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 1(a)  shows the X-ray diffraction patterns of the HfNbTaTiZr alloy in the as-cast, as-rolled, and as-annealed (1250°C, 6h) states. All diffraction patterns exhibit single BCC structure with a lattice constant of 3.406Å. Fig. 2 shows the OM images of samples annealed at 1250°C for different times. Based on the OM images, the grains sizes of the samples are plotted as functions of annealing time for each annealing temperature in Fig. 1(b) . As can be expected, the grain size increases with the annealing time and temperature. The equation for grain growth can be expressed in the following general form[10]:(1)Dn−D0n=Ctwhere D is the grain size at annealing time t, D0is the initial grain size, n is the growth exponent, and C is a kinetic constant. Because grain sizes are at least tens of micrometers after annealing, D0at recrystallization can be treated as zero. The growth exponent n is approximately 3.5. The plot of D3.5versus time is shown in Fig. 1(c) . Well linear relationship is found. Factors such as texture and pinning effect by solutes and second phase particles are known to increase n. Because second phase particles are not observed in the grain boundaries of our alloys, pinning by particles is excluded, and the solute-drag effect becomes the most probable reason[8,11]. Liu et al. proposed this solute-drag mechanism in addition to sluggish diffusion effect for the slow grain growth phenomenon found in single-FCC CoCrFeMnNi[8]. In the present study, we propose that the solute-drag effect is significant in the whole-solute matrix of HEAs as compared with conventional solid solution alloy. This relates to the energy reason that the different sizes of abundant solutes along grain boundaries would in-situ adjust their relative positions to form the low-energy configuration of grain boundaries during boundary migration.","['f0005', 'f0010', 'f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3,Results and discussion,"The kinetic constant C in Eq.(1)could be expressed as Eq.(2):(2)C=C0exp(−QRT)where Q is the apparent activation energy of grain growth, R is the gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and C0is a constant. Fig. 1(d)  shows the ln C versus 1/T plot in which a good linear relationship is seen. The activation energy of grain growth is 389kJ/mol. This value is markedly higher than the self-diffusion activation energies of Hf (162kJ/mol), Ti (198kJ/mol) and Zr (126kJ/mol), and close to that of Nb (397kJ/mol) and Ta (413kJ/mol)[12]. Although the diffusion coefficients and activation energies of diffusion for composing elements in the present alloy have not been reported, it is expected from the study on the diffusion of CoCrFeMnNi[13]that the activation energies of Nb and Ta diffusion in the present alloy is very likely higher than that for their self diffusions. It is noted that the activation energies of grain growth in HfNbTaTiZr and that of self-diffusion in Nb and Ta have similar values. This suggests that the grain growth in HfNbTaTiZr is directly related to the volume diffusion through the lattice, whose rate is controlled by the slowest species, i.e. Nb and Ta. Migration of grain boundaries cannot proceed except the average composition is maintained, i.e., the fast-moving species need to wait for the slow ones.",['f0005'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"To investigate the grain size strengthening and tensile behavior of the present HEA, annealed samples with average grain sizes: 38, 81, and 128µm (named as: Sample A, Sample B, and Sample C, respectively) were selected for tensile testing. Fig. 3(a)  shows their engineering and true stress–strain curves. All the samples have the same Young's modulus of 81GPa. The yield strengths of Samples A, B, and C are 958±2.1, 944±2.1, and 940±0.7MPa, respectively. The ultimate tensile strengths are 974±0.7, 959±1.5, and 953±0.7MPa, respectively. The corresponding elongations (or engineering fracture strain) are 20%, 18%, and 15%, respectively. In addition, the true fracture strains estimated from the reduction of area are 1.23, 1.13, and 0.97, respectively. All these demonstrate that grain refining could simultaneously enhance strength and ductility, which is not commonly found in metals[14].",['f0015'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"It is noted that slight work softening occurs before necking in the engineering stress–strain curves but small work hardening still exists in the true stress–strain curves. Small work hardening is proposed to be related to the high yield strength of HfNbTaTiZr, which is due to large solution hardening from its whole-solute matrix with severe lattice distortion. This is entirely different from the high work hardening found in lower strength FCC HEAs[3,9]and might be an unique feature of BCC HEAs. Similar low work hardening is found in BCC metals at low temperatures where the yield strength becomes markedly higher[15]. Both might have similar basic reasons. Physically, low work hardening means high dynamic recovery which eliminates most hardening of increased dislocations due to the multiplication from dislocation sources. It is expected that higher dislocation density (e.g. at higher strain) and higher applied stress for deforming high strength alloys would have higher strain energy and thus larger driving force to induce dynamic recovery. The very low work hardening in the present alloy suggests that its distorted whole-solute BCC matrix having high-strength and large lattice strain could potentially raise the driving force to reduce overall strain energy under the high applied stress level (>σy~1000MPa). This lattice distortion effect is significant since their atomic size difference is quite large (atomic sizes of Hf, Nb, Ta, Ti and Zr are 1.58, 1.47, 1.47, 1.46, and 1.60Å, respectively, and maximum difference between unlike atomic pairs is up to 9.6%). As for the enhancement of ductility and ultimate tensile strength by smaller grain size, it relates with Considere's criterion[16]which suggests that a higher work hardening rate would give higher necking strain and necking strength (ultimate tensile strength). Apparently, the work hardening is higher for smaller grain size from true stress–strain curves in Fig. 3 , the enhancement is thus explained.",['f0015'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"In order to evaluate the relation between strength and grain size, the yield stress as functions of grain size was plotted in Fig. 3(b) . The fitting line agrees well with the Hall–Petch equation:(3)σ=σ0+kσD−1/2where σ0is the intrinsic stress, D is the grain size and kσis the Hall–Petch coefficient. The Hall–Petch coefficient kσof yield stress are 240MPaμm−1/2. This suggests that grain size strengthening is significant in the present alloy.",['f0015'],[]
4,Conclusions,"The grain growth kinetics and tensile properties in the HfNbTaTiZr BCC refractory high-entropy alloy was investigated. The activation energy of grain growth at 1200~1350°C is 389kJ/mol, and the growth exponent is 3.5. The grain growth rate is controlled by the slowest two components, i.e., Nb and Ta. The slow grain boundary migration is a result of the solute-drag mechanism. Grain refinement increases both strength and ductility. The tensile yield strength, elongation and true fracture strain of HfNbTaTiZr HEA with smallest grain size 38µm are 958MPa, 20%, and 1.23, respectively. The grain size strengthening is significant and obeys the Hall–Petch relationship.",[],[]
