fig1,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.02.048/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,"EBSD-band contrast (BC) maps (left) and BC maps overlaid by inverse pole figure (IPF) maps (right) of the material after (a) hot rolling and homogenization and after (b) 10% cold rolling, (c) 25% cold rolling, and (d) 50% cold rolling. Substantial formation of deformation twins was observed after 50% cold rolling as shown in the inset of (d) in (e). White lines denote ∑3 (60°<111>) grain boundaries."
fig2,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.02.048/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,"TEM bright field (BF) images of the material after 50% cold rolling. (a) The deformed microstructure is dominated by the occurrence of dislocation cells. (b) In addition, thick deformation twins are observed. These twins were found to contain a high density of dislocations (inset in (b)). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern with [-110]γzone axis reveals the twin orientation relationship."

The inset highlights a non-recrystallized matrix grain containing deformation twins surrounded by recrystallization nuclei. The SAED pattern with [-110]γzone axis was taken from the deformed matrix.

(a) A high density of fine deformation twins is formed during tensile testing (SAED pattern with [001]γzone axis). (b) Thicker deformation twins induced by cold rolling undergo secondary twinning during further deformation by tensile testing, as highlighted by the inset of (b)."

(a) A high density of fine deformation twins formed in the non-recrystallized matrix during tension. (b) & (c) In contrast, the recrystallized grains did not undergo deformation twinning. The SAED pattern with [-110]γzone axis in (c) reveal that the recrystallized grain has a very similar orientation to the non-recrystallized matrix. Deformation twinning in recrystallized grains was only observed sparsely, as shown in the inset of (d)."
