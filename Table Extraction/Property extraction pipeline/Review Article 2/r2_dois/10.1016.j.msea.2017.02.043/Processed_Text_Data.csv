0,Abstract,"The tensile deformation and strain hardening behaviors of an equimolar CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) were investigated and compared with low and medium entropy equiatomic alloys (LEA and MEA). The HEA had a lower yield strength than the MEA because the addition of Mn weakens solid solution hardening in the HEA. However, deformation twinning induced the multiple stage strain hardening behavior of the HEA and enhanced strength and elongation. Using tensile-interrupted electron backscatter diffraction analysis, geometrically necessary dislocations were observed as plume-shaped features in grain interior, and a considerable texture was characterized, which is typical of face centered cubic metals. Moreover, the relationship between favorably oriented grains and twinning in the HEA bore a clear resemblance to the same tendency in TWIP steels. The thickness of the twin bundles was less than 100nm. A high density of stacking defects was found in the nanotwins. Nano twinning and stacking faults were found to contribute to the remarkable mechanical properties. Deformation induced twinning not only demonstrated the dynamic Hall-Petch effect but also changed dislocation cell substructures into microband structures.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Most conventionally produced metallic materials, such as steel, titanium and aluminum alloys, are based on one, or rarely two, principal elements. To improve their mechanical and chemical properties, composition designs using various additional alloying elements have been studied. Unlike these conventional alloy systems, high-entropy alloy (HEA) systems contain at least five major elements, at concentrations ranging between 5 and 35at%, and have attracted intensive research during the past decade[1–3]. The implicit hypothesis in the term “high-entropy” is that the entropic stabilization of a random solid solution phase is achieved against intermetallic compounds when numerous elements are mixed in an equimolar fraction[2,4]. This assumption is not always valid for all multi-component alloys because the high-entropy effect has overestimated the real mixing entropy of a HEA[3]. Nevertheless, the formation of a single solid solution phase of many HEAs has promising properties for various applications, and has generated extensive research interest in the scientific community as well[4,5].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Among various HEAs, an equiatomic alloy of Co, Cr, Fe, Mn, and Ni has been widely studied because of its excellent mechanical properties at room temperature, and even better properties at cryogenic temperature[4,6,7]. The fracture toughness values of this single face-centered cubic (FCC) metal measured at 77K were found to exceed 200MPam1/2at crack initiation, and rise to >300MPam1/2for stable crack growth[4]. Deformation twinning promotes these outstanding properties at cryogenic temperatures. However, it has recently been reported that twinning is not observed at room temperature due to the high critical twinning stress of ~720MPa at ambient temperature in tension[8].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"It is widely accepted that deformation twinning induces an increase in the strain hardening rate of low stacking fault energy (SFE) FCC metals. SFE is a material property, and it controls the ease of cross-slip. In low SFE metals such as austenitic steels and brass, whose SFEs are generally lower than 20mJ/m2, deformation twinning is their main deformation mechanism. It is interesting to note that the equimolar CoCrFeMnNi HEA has a SFE of 20–25mJ/m2as reported by Zaddach et al.[9].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Understanding the microstructure-property relationship is of great importance for material development and engineering applications, and accurate characterization of strain hardening behavior is the most widely used technique to investigate microstructural plastic deformation in a material.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In this research, the deformation behavior of equimolar CoCrFeMnNi HEA was compared to CoNi and CoCrFeNi equiatomic alloys, which are classified as low entropy and medium entropy alloys (LEA and MEA), respectively. The tensile deformation behavior of the HEA is discussed in detail in terms of strain hardening rate and grain orientation. Interestingly, we found that deformation twinning occurred in the HEA during the tensile test, and the unique nano-twinning behavior was analyzed using tensile-interrupted electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Moreover, the observed dislocation substructures were found to be different from previously reported dislocation cell structures.",[],[]
2,Material and methods,"A series of metals composed of CoNi, CoCrFeNi, and CoCrFeMnNi were fabricated for analysis with a common basis for comparison. Their mixing entropies, approximately represented by the configurational entropy, are 0.69R, 1.39R, and 1.61R, respectively. With this range of entropies, the alloy series cover a representative range of LEA, MEA, and HEA[10].",[],[]
2,Material and methods,"All the experimental alloys were vacuum arc-melted from starting elements with purities higher than 99.9wt%. The specimens were re-melted and re-solidified at least four times under the protection of argon to ensure their uniform compositions. Then, the alloys were cast into a 10×20×40mm3slab. After surface machining of the cast slabs, a cold-rolling reduction of 65% was performed from an initial thickness of 8mm to a final thickness of 3.2mm. The alloys were then subjected to a homogenization treatment at 1100°C for 6h and subsequently quenched in water.",[],[]
2,Material and methods,"The sheets were wire-cut by an electrical discharge machine into tensile specimens with gauge lengths of 19mm and widths of 3mm. The final thickness of the specimens was 2mm, and any oxides in the top and bottom surface layer were removed. Mechanical properties were measured using compression and tensile tests with an initial strain rate of 1.0×10−4s−1. During the mechanical tests, precise strains were measured using digital image correlation (DIC) with a vision strain gauge system (ARAMIS 5M, GOM mbH). Random speckle pattern was applied by spray painting on the tensile specimens, and the average speckle size and spacing were both approximately 35µm.",[],[]
2,Material and methods,"Deformation behavior and twinning were analyzed, using the tensile-interrupted EBSD to examine the same area of a specimen in a 3D Total Analysis device (Helios Nanolab) equipped with a field-emission gun and a Hikari EBSD detector at an accelerating voltage of 20kV. Deformed microstructures of the LEA and MEA were observed on the uniformly elongated region of the fractured tensile specimen using the EBSD. Crystal orientations were determined using an automatic scanning beam. Confidence index (CI) gives an indication of reliability, and all data with a CI below 0.1 were removed for a correct solution. Ag nanodots were employed to produce the surface pattern for the DIC[11]to analyze local heterogeneous strain using the DIC software (ARAMIS) and field emission secondary electron microscopy (FE-SEM) images. For the fine structural analysis, TEM samples of particular grains selected from the tensile-interrupted EBSD sample were prepared using focused ion beam (FIB). High-resolution TEM (HRTEM) images were taken using a JEOL JEM-2200FS with an image Cs-corrector.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Tensile results and strain hardening behavior," Fig. 1 a displays the engineering stress-strain curves of the three solid solution alloys, obtained from tensile tests. In the EBSD results, the grain sizes of the LEA, MEA and HEA alloys were 40, 39, and 17µm, respectively (not shown here). As the number of solid solution elements is increased, the stress-strain curves indicate that the strength-ductility trade-off is overcome.",['f0005'],[]
3.1,Results.Tensile results and strain hardening behavior,"In fact, in equimolar solid solution alloys, yield strength does not increase monotonically as the number of elements increases[12]. Although the MEA had a much higher yield strength (217.6±9.9MPa) compared to that of the LEA (157.9±2.1MPa), the difference in yield strength between the HEA (229.6±4.9MPa) and the MEA was only 12MPa.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Tensile results and strain hardening behavior,"When we consider the grain size effect (the Hall-Petch equation), whose parameters were obtained from Reference[6], an HEA generally has lower yield strengths than an MEA. The nature of the constituent elements is also crucial, in addition to the number of elements[12]. The addition of Mn has a rather negative influence on the yield strength. However, the HEA exhibited a higher work-hardening rate from the beginning of deformation, and significantly enhanced uniform elongation. The post-necking behavior of the alloys looked similar, but the HEA demonstrated a 10.7±0.9% post-elongation, which is significantly enhanced from the 7.4±0.2% post-elongation of the MEA.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Tensile results and strain hardening behavior,"Strain hardening responses can be characterized from stress-strain curves, and the strain hardening rates at various stress values were numerically computed ( Fig. 1 b). The normalized strain hardening rate ((dσ/dɛ)/G) against (σ-σ0) was chosen.Gandσ0are the shear modulus of the material and the initial yield strength of the alloy, respectively. (dσ/dɛ)/Gis a more accurate parameter of the dislocation density in the deformed material, and it allows us to directly compare the strain hardening behavior of different materials[13]. Subtractingσ0fromσeliminates other strength contributors from dislocation multiplication. Especially, solid solution strengthening contributes significantly toσ0of the alloys considered in this research. The shear moduli of the alloys were taken from Reference[12].",['f0005'],[]
3.1,Results.Tensile results and strain hardening behavior,"For comparison, strain hardening in polycrystalline Cu was investigated, and the curve for the high SFE material only exhibited stage III, which is associated with dynamic recovery processes. On the other hand, 304 stainless steel (304SS), a typical low SFE material, unlike Cu demonstrates a complex strain hardening behavior due to the planar distributions of dislocations and deformation twinning. Recent intensive studies have proven that FCC alloys with a low SFE exhibit high strain hardening rates and a good balance of strength and ductility[14,15]. Deformation twinning plays a key role in these materials.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Tensile results and strain hardening behavior,"Apparently, the LEA, MEA, and HEA alloys have distinctively different strain hardening behaviors than either Cu or 304SS. The strain hardening behaviors of the LEA and MEA can be divided into three different stages. The arrows indicate changes in the deformation stages of the LEA. The first stage is characterized by a continuous decrease in strain hardening rate in the initial deformation. Although the first stage of the LEA and MEA strain hardening behaviors ends at 77 and 102MPa of (σ-σ0), respectively, these two strength values represent the same true strain (~4%) for each of them. The additional alloying of Cr and Fe in the MEA increased solid solution hardening (SSH) and also enhanced dislocation multiplication.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Tensile results and strain hardening behavior,"The main characteristic revealed in the HEA is the occurrence of multiple-stage strain hardening. Among equiatomic alloys, the HEA exhibits the most complicated hardening behavior. The green dashed lines in Fig. 1 b distinguish the multiple deformation stages. Although, the strain hardening rate continuously decreases, its slope is altered due to changes in deformation mechanism and microstructural evolutions during tensile deformation. Undoubtedly, the larger strain hardening enhances tensile strength and improves uniform elongation.",['f0005'],[]
3.1,Results.Tensile results and strain hardening behavior,"Furthermore, it is plausible that an additional hardening mechanism is activated in the 4th hardening stage of the HEA. The HEA has a smaller grain size than the others, but the grain size effect cannot be the primary reason for the higher strain hardening rate over the whole range of normalized stress. Besides, the improvement in ductility is obviously not related to the smaller grain size. The influence of the number of components on the propensity of fracture strain is remarkable in the HEA. The increase in fracture strain from the LEA to MEA is 0.05, but the increment from the MEA to HEA is 0.2.",[],[]
3.2,Results.Microstructure,"The microstructures of annealed and deformed HEAs are depicted in Fig. 2 . The annealed HEA has a high volume fraction of annealing twins (ATs). Various different types of AT morphologies can be distinguished in the 2-dimensional optical microscopy observations. Grain structure is generally equiaxial, but the morphologies of the ATs are irregular. The formation of ATs is related to an effective reduction in grain boundary energy caused by an increase in the twin boundary fraction during grain growth[16].",['f0010'],[]
3.2,Results.Microstructure,"In the 55% elongated specimen, highly deformed microstructures can be recognized ( Fig. 2 b). In previous research on the CoCrFeMnNi HEA, slip lines have usually been observed after tensile tests without any other type of deformation marking. Interestingly, in this study distinct deformation markings were found, which are believed to be clusters of deformation twins. These deformation markings are widely distributed but not observed in every grain. This signifies that deformation twinning occurs in specific grains.",['f0010'],[]
3.3,Results.Tensile-interrupted EBSD results,"Tensile-interrupted EBSD analysis was performed to investigate the local deformation behavior of the HEA specimen. Orientation maps are presented in Fig. 3 . At the 1st step (ε = 6.7%), no prominent changes were found compared to the initial state, but inhomogeneous deformation occurred near grain boundaries. In Fig. 3 b, local lattice curvatures were developed in some grains. The slip character of the HEA is planar because its low SFE prohibits the cross slip of partial dislocations. A few slip systems are activated during the deformation; thus the HEA is deformed through slip lines.","['f0015', 'f0015']",[]
3.3,Results.Tensile-interrupted EBSD results,"At the 2nd step (ε = 20%), intra-granular lattice curvatures have begun to develop in most of the grains ( Fig. 3 c). In addition, lattice rotations are distinguishable in many grains. However, no features of deformation twinning were found in the 2nd stage. Unfortunately, the EBSD results of the 3rd stage (ε = 55%) did not show reliable CI values in some areas, due to the roughened surface.",['f0015'],[]
3.3,Results.Tensile-interrupted EBSD results," Fig. 4 presents inverse pole figures (IPF) along the tensile axis direction. The grain orientations of the initial to the 2nd stages were taken from the EBSD data in Fig. 3 , but the IPF data of the 3rd stage was taken from a different tensile specimen. As shown in Fig. 4 a, the as-annealed HEA is characterized by a nearly random texture. After the 1st stage, a modest change can be observed from the scatters of the IPF because of local misorientation curvatures, but lattice rotation associated with tensile texture was weak.","['f0020', 'f0015', 'f0020']",[]
3.3,Results.Tensile-interrupted EBSD results,"After the 2nd stage, the scatters of the IPF became more intense, and noticeable lattice rotation occurred ( Fig. 4 c). Also, grains that were initially oriented close to <101>//TA (//TA denotes parallel to tensile axis) did not maintain their initial orientation, whereas the deformed grains became orientated close to <111>//TA. In the 3rd stage, a considerable texture can be observed ( Fig. 4 d), in which the <111> directions are parallel to the tension axis, which is a typical of FCC metals.","['f0020', 'f0020']",[]
3.3,Results.Tensile-interrupted EBSD results,"Obviously, deformation twinning occurred in the HEA before the formation of necking. The EBSD results are clear evidences of deformation twinning ( Fig. 5 ). Consistent with other low SFE metals, the crystallographic orientation dependence of deformation twinning is found in the HEA. On the surface where EBSD was measured, the deformation twins appear in grains closely oriented to <111>//TA. All of the observed deformation twins adjoined grain boundaries, indicating deformation twinning started at the grain boundaries.",['f0025'],[]
3.3,Results.Tensile-interrupted EBSD results," Fig. 6 displays a more precisely measured progression of the deformation of the grain shown in Fig. 5 b. For this selected region, the EBSD step size was 70nm. The grain, which was initially parallel to <111>//TA, hardly rotated its lattice, but local lattice misorientations became intense with increasing tensile strain. It is clear that deformation twinning did not occur until the 2nd step, and then the additional hardening mechanism after further elongation was directly related to the developed twins.","['f0030', 'f0025']",[]
3.3,Results.Tensile-interrupted EBSD results,"The dependency of the twin induced plasticity on grain orientation was analyzed using IPFs of the grains shown in Fig. 5 . Grains which were oriented close to <111>//TA underwent slight lattice rotation, then deformation twinning occurred ( Fig. 7 ). However, deformation twins were not found in other grains initially orientated to <001>//TA and <101>//TA. This indicates that the onset of deformation twinning is intimately linked to the influences of that initial orientation. The relationship between grains that are favorably oriented and twinning in the HEA show a clear resemblance to the same tendency in TWIP steels[14,17–19]. The grain orientations where the highest Schmid factor for twinningmtwis larger than the highest Schmid factor for slipmsare favorable for twinning in the HEA as well. However, notable deformation twinning was not detected in <111>//TA oriented grains of the LEA or the MEA by EBSD ( Fig. 8 ).","['f0025', 'f0035', 'f0040']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Geometrically necessary dislocation and deformed surface,"Deformation behavior of the HEA was studied using the EBSD and DIC. The DIC measures the total deformation gradient including total strain and total rotation, and the EBSD can calculate a density of GNDs from the orientation differences between neighboring points using continuum dislocation mechanics developed by Nye and Kröner if elastic strain is negligible[20–23]. GNDs are needed to preserve the lattice continuity through accommodating lattice distortion caused by different active slip systems and different magnitudes of plastic slip among neighboring regions of individual grains, and they contribute to strain hardening. After 6.7% macroscopic strain, GNDs were generated as a result of the tensile deformation ( Fig. 9 a). Distribution of GNDs was not uniform because of complex strain gradients due to the incompatibilities from neighboring grains. Interestingly, the regions of greater GNDs in grain interior were formed as plume-shaped features indicated by white arrows. The plume-shaped GNDs originated close to the triple junction (TJ) where various slip bands from the adjacent grains meet the boundaries. After 20% macroscopic strain, the average GND density remarkably increased, and the most of grains showed the plume-shaped features of GNDs in their interior ( Fig. 9 b).","['f0045', 'f0045']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Geometrically necessary dislocation and deformed surface," Fig. 9 c demonstrated the details of GND distributions in the HEA after 6.7% macroscopic strain. Step size was 160nm for this EBSD measurement. A high density of GNDs was observed near the grain boundaries and ATs. There were three plume-shaped features in Fig. 9 c. Two of them generated near the TJ (white arrows), and the rest arose from the grain boundary (yellow arrow). The plume-shaped GND distribution has been reported in previous researches[24,25]. The localized stress field from the dislocation pile-up near a grain boundary occurs the plume-shaped GNDs into the adjoined grain. The dislocations transferred into the adjoined grain do not continued to slip for long distances because of the low Schmid factor for their slip system[24]. More occurrences of the plume-shaped GNDs near the TJ should be a high internal stress field in the vicinity of the TJ owing to the grains’ strain incompatibilities. Primary or secondary slip lines were bent due to the plume-shaped features ( Fig. 9 c), and the plume-shaped GNDs were extended into the grain interior when the macroscopic strain was increased ( Fig. 9 b). In other words, the extra GNDs were generated due to the occurrence of plasticity through the new slip system which was different from the primary and secondary slip systems. The GNDs, besides statistically stored dislocation, hampered the dislocation motion and enhanced hardening of the HEA.","['f0045', 'f0045', 'f0045', 'f0045']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Geometrically necessary dislocation and deformed surface,"Tremendous slip lines are generated during the tensile test, and they cause significant local gradients in strain ( Fig. 10 ). At the beginning of plasticity, the primary and secondary slip lines were created together in the HEA. The maximum effective strain obtained at this stage for the selected area peaks at above 3%, whereas between the slip lines it drops down to below 0.5 ( Fig. 10 a). For a uniform extension of 10%, the maximum effective strain increases above 25% ( Fig. 10 b). This implies that the strain rates within the bands can be much higher than the applied strain rate like the austenitic stainless steel[25].","['f0050', 'f0050', 'f0050']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Geometrically necessary dislocation and deformed surface,"Shear angle gradients are also arising during the tensile deformation. Positive and negative shear angles are observed among the slip lines ( Fig. 10 c). Moreover, the distinct regions, divided by opposite sign of shear angle in a grain, indicates a couple of deformation domains in one grain. These phenomena signify that the plasticity of the HEA is very heterogeneous across the shear lines and among the deformation domains. Deformation domains are usually found near grain boundaries. Local strain heterogeneity is highly affected by grain boundaries and orientations of neighboring grains.",['f0050'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Geometrically necessary dislocation and deformed surface,"TEM samples were prepared using a focused ion beam (FIB) technique for three selected grains that were initially parallel to <111>, <110> and <100>//TA, to obtain details of their microstructural evolution ( Fig. 11 ). The TEM samples were lifted out perpendicular to the TA (yellow rectangle). Among the three grains, substantial lattice rotation took place exclusively in the <110>//TA grain.",['f0055'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Geometrically necessary dislocation and deformed surface,"In the CoCrFeMnNi HEA, deformation is highly influenced by the dissociation of perfect dislocations to Shockley partial dislocations, and the formation of wide stacking faults due to its low SFE[6]. The overlapping of stacking faults on the {111} planes forms the planar defects which trigger shear bands, which is a collective term for the planar defects. In this study, uncountable slip lines were generated in all the grains ( Fig. 11 ). In addition, plastic deformation also occurred along secondary slip lines due to the activation of secondary slip systems, because the Schmid factors of some slip planes are not exceptionally different from the primary. As the secondary slip proceeded, it could be deduced that the dislocation configurations changed to form dislocation networks, or so-called dislocation substructures.",['f0055'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Geometrically necessary dislocation and deformed surface,"In Fig. 11 a, deformation twins can be observed in the SEM image, possibly due to the strong dependence of the backscatter electron signal on the orientation of the crystal lattice planes. Corresponding twinning regions in the orientation map were in good agreement. A shear step that formed along the twin boundary (TB, indicated by the open yellow arrow) arose from the deformation incompatibility between the twinning region and untwinned matrix region, demonstrating effective blockages of TBs on dislocation glide.",['f0055'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Deformation twinning in HEA,The two TEM dark-field (DF) images in Fig. 12 a and b clearly capture deformation twinning in the equimolar CoCrFEMnNi alloy. Electron beams passing through the individual (001)Mand (1-1-1)Treciprocal lattice points shown in the [110] zone axis SAED pattern of Fig. 12 c were acquired to obtain the DF images. The narrow twinning regions are bright in Fig. 12 b because the corresponding beam was predominantly diffracted by the twin oriented lattices.,"['f0060', 'f0060', 'f0060']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Deformation twinning in HEA,"Unlike the EBSD result, nanotwin bundles were observed in the TEM images. Due to the interaction volume between the solid sample and the electron beam, the nanotwin bundles could be identified as micro-twins in the EBSD. It should be emphasized that the origin and strengthening effect of deformation twinning in this study differs from the effect of twins that occur at cryogenic temperatures. At low temperatures, deformation twinning initiates as the major deformation mechanism at very low strains, and their TBs are fully coherent. Deformation twinning usually occurs simultaneously with the slip of dislocations, and deformation twinning laws specify the composition plane and the direction of shear[26–28]. Therefore, slip-twin interactions are more complicated than those at cryogenic temperatures, because a lot of dislocations had already been multiplied due to the imposed tensile strain. Especially, a high density of GNDs in grain interior can prohibit either lateral and vertical growth of deformation twins. Because the GNDs alter lattice orientations, and a higher stress should be required to produce TBs with the exact direction and magnitude of shear of deformation twinning. In the EBSD results, deformation twins did not completely penetrate their parent grains. Probably, the GNDs prevent the growth of deformation twins, and increase the requisite stress for passing by them. GND-twin interactions might be one of strengthening contributors of the HEA. Further investigation is needed to fully comprehend this phenomenon.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Deformation twinning in HEA,"The thicknesses of the twin bundles were less than 100nm ( Figs. 12 b and13a). Twins of a few nanometers were embedded together in the form of a bundle ( Fig. 13 b). The formation of deformation twin boundaries leads to the so-called dynamic Hall-Petch effect, because the twin boundaries are suddenly generated obstacles to dislocation glide[29,30].","['f0060', 'f0065', 'f0065']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Deformation twinning in HEA,"For thick deformation twins, a relatively low applied stress is required to activate slip transmission. When the twin becomes thinner, a higher external stress is needed for dislocations to cross the nanotwins[31]. According to the decisive evidence in the EBSD and TEM results in this study, deformation twinning plays a crucial role in strain hardening of the HEA at large strains. The extra strain hardening mechanism of the HEA contributes to its higher strength as well as the remarkably improved ductility, compared to the LEA and MEA in tension.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Deformation twinning in HEA,"Also, an interesting substructure was observed at higher magnifications. In the nanotwins, a lot of parallel stacking faults (SFs) were located along the twin boundaries ( Fig. 13 b and c). The inset SAED pattern in Fig. 13 a shows the twinned pattern as well as the diffraction spots elongated with traces of steaks. The long steaks in the SAED pattern emerge from the stacking defects[32,33].","['f0065', 'f0065']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Deformation twinning in HEA,"In Fig. 13 b, the SFs were located near the nano TBs. Dislocations generated at the twin boundary should be dissociated into two partial dislocations. However, they could not be transmitted to the nanotwins, and the SFs may have aligned on the {111} planes near the TBs. The HRTEM image in Fig. 13 c shows abundant SFs within the nanotwins, and defect-free volumes of twins were scarce. It is possible that the propagation of SFs along directions parallel to a TB were tied up, due to the strong blockages of the nano TBs.","['f0065', 'f0065']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Deformation twinning in HEA,"These unusual nanostructures have been reported in a few as-deposited materials and metal nanowires, and extremely high strengths, even close to theoretical strength, have been achieved by nanotwins with a high density of SFs[33–35]. As mentioned earlier, the contributions to strengthening differ depending on twin thickness. In thick twins, dislocations form pile-ups and produce a stress concentration at the TBs, and these dislocations propagate across the twins with a lower applied stress to activate slip transmission. If the twin spacing is too thin to have a dislocation pile-up, an extremely high external stress is required for the dislocation to cross the TBs[31,36].",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Deformation twinning in HEA,"For this reason, there was a strong resistance to the lateral propagation of SFs along directions parallel to the twin and matrix interfaces in the nanotwins of the deformed HEA. When a partial dislocation propagating on lateral {111} planes encountered SFs, it experienced increasing resistance. The partial dislocations became congested because the increased resistance made dislocation glide through the TBs more difficult. The Shockley partial dislocations nucleated at the TBs, and the SF cross-structure was also observed in the HRTEM image ( Fig. 13 c). With increasing strain, the SFs extend across the matrix. This indicates that the plastic deformation of the matrix adjoining the nanotwins was carried over by SFs emerging from the TBs.",['f0065'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Deformation twinning in HEA,"Meanwhile, secondary twins were not detected in the EBSD and TEM results. Moreover, the fraction of twinned grains in the tensile-interrupted EBSD was lower than in the OM image of Fig. 2 b. The free surface-constraint on gliding dislocations is much weaker than the interior-constraint by GB[37,38]. Consequently, the free surface, which was measured in the tensile-interrupted EBSD, creates a weakening effect, and a lower external stress is needed to glide dislocations in the surface grains. Therefore, the hardened critical shear stress of dislocation exceeds the critical twinning shear stress in fewer grains on the surface.",['f0010'],[]
4.3,Discussion.Dislocation substructure,"STEM images of <100> and <110>//TA grains are shown in Fig. 14 . Deformation twinning did not occur as shown in the SAED patterns, but a high density of defects can be observed in both grains with similar dislocation substructures. The deformation substructures were identified as microbands (MBs) and dislocation cells. The dislocations tangle with each other and form dislocation walls, due to the increased resistance to slip in the slip systems. The dislocation walls act as a barrier to dislocation motion. This high dislocation density is the main factor affecting the high hardening rate of the HEA. The MBs are subsequently formed from the dense dislocation walls (DDW) by a gradual multiple slip process[39,40].",['f0070'],[]
4.3,Discussion.Dislocation substructure,"In previous studies, it was determined that grains of the CoCrFeMnNi HEA are subdivided into regions of equiaxial cells at high strains in tension[6,8]. In this study, dislocation cells were further subdivided by the formation of the MBs, while deformation twinning further increased the strength of the HEA. MB-induced plasticity provides an excellent combination of strength and ductility in metals[41,42]. Deformation-induced twinning behavior not only has an effect on the dynamic Hall-Petch relationship but also changes the dislocation substructure in the HEA.",[],[]
4.4,Discussion.Influence on post-necking,"It is generally well known that strain rate sensitivity (SRS) strongly controls post-necking behavior by controlling the instability of stress localization[43]. However, this is not always accepted to be the case for all metals. Recently, the ability to tolerate damage has been considered the main property for post-necking strain in newly developed high strength metals[44].",[],[]
4.4,Discussion.Influence on post-necking,"In the rate jump tests, the SRS of the LEA, MEA and HEA were measured to be 0.0032±0.0005, 0.0070±0.0014 and 0.0064±0.0014, respectively. The LEA had the lowest SRS, and the MEA had a higher value than the HEA. Therefore, SRS is not the main reason for the enhanced post-necking strain of the HEA.",[],[]
4.4,Discussion.Influence on post-necking,"In the HEA, mechanical twinning is a crucial damage tolerance mechanism at cryogenic temperatures[4]. Moreover, at ambient temperatures, nano-twinning has been observed at a crack tip, and the nano-twinning impeded crack propagation and delayed fracture[45]. Deformation twinning does not guarantee high post-necking strain, for example, in TWIP steels. However, TWIP steels usually exhibit negative SRS, which makes their mechanical behavior extremely sensitive to notches. Judging from the results of previous research and this study, it can be interpreted that the observed deformation twinning might enhance the post-necking strain of the HEA.",[],[]
4.5,Discussion.Mn addition and deformation twinning,"The addition of Mn is the most important factor contributing to differences between the MEA and HEA. Adding Mn decreased SFE from 30 to 35mJ/m2to 20–25mJ/m2[9]. As a consequence, the possibility of twinning at room temperature was increased, because cross slip becomes more difficult. Furthermore, a lower rate of dislocation annihilation is expected, because the lower cross-slip activity suggests that dynamic recovery processes such as the annihilation of screw dislocations is limited.",[],[]
4.5,Discussion.Mn addition and deformation twinning,"However, as mentioned above, yield strength was decreased with the addition of Mn. SSH is usually explained by atomic size and shear modulus misfits[46]. The lattice distortion (δai) and modulus distortion (δGi) in the vicinity of an elementican be simply estimated as an average of the size and modulus differences of this element with its neighbors[47,48]:(1)δai=1312∑cjδaijandδGi=1312∑cjδGijHere cjis the atomic fraction of ajelement, and δaij=2(ri- rj)/(ri+ rj) is the atomic size difference between the elementsiandj. δGijdenotes the modulus difference of elementsiandjin the same manner. Salishchevet al.have already shown that Mn brings lower atomic radius and shear modulus misfits using the above equations[48]. However, the limit set of their experimental data did not provide proper evidences on this issue. More recently, Okamotoet al.have proposed a new parameter named ‘mean-square atomic displacements’ to estimate SSH of multi-component solid solution alloys[49]. The parameter implies that SSH is determined by the average displacements of the constituent atoms from regular lattice positions. In their theoretical work, the CoCrFeMnNi HEA has the lower SSH than CoCrFeNi MEA alloy. The termσ0is arising from the many strength contributions such as solutes, grain boundaries, precipitates, and dislocation density. In this study, the contributions of precipitates and dislocation density can be negligible. When Hall-Petch relationship is considered, we can conclude Mn addition weakens SSH in the HEA. Diminished SSH resulting from the increased addition of Mn has been also observed in TWIP steels[44].",[],[]
4.5,Discussion.Mn addition and deformation twinning,"A lower stacking fault energy does not always represent a higher hardening rate. The shear modulus corrected strain hardening data of CoCrFeNi and FeNi is evidence of this in equiatomic solid solution alloys[12]. Smaller grain size generally causes lower work hardening in equiatomic HEAs[6]. Therefore, when we consider the grain sizes of the equiatomic alloys used in this study, the HEA showed a remarkable hardening rate.",[],[]
4.5,Discussion.Mn addition and deformation twinning,"There is one argument that might be considered. It is possible that the addition of Mn increases short range ordering (SRO), and the high degree of SRO maybe provide the high strain hardening. Mn-C and Mn-Si clusters have been considered to be the main factors affecting work hardening in high-Mn steel and Al alloys, respectively[50–52]. The high SRO ratio can alter the localized stress fields of dislocations, which act as obstacles prohibiting dislocation glides. Although, SRO has not been found yet in the CoCrFeMnNi alloy, the ordering of Cr in the CoCrFeNi equiatomic alloy has been found by TEM[53].",[],[]
4.5,Discussion.Mn addition and deformation twinning,"The formation of nanotwins at room temperature is unusual in previously reported references. One of the possible reasons may be Mn oxides. Due to the high reactivity of Mn with oxygen, Mn oxides are difficult to completely eliminate. Hard inclusions cause strain localization. Then, they initiate cracks and accelerate the fracture[54,55]. As we can see in Fig. 11 a, the Mn oxide particle, indicated by a white arrow, initiated a crack. In worse situations, the particles lead to fracture before the premature exhaustion of the hardening state, which is lower than the critical stress of deformation twinning.",['f0055'],[]
4.5,Discussion.Mn addition and deformation twinning,"Another possible reason is the interactions of impurity elements with Mn. Further analyses are needed to reveal the exact mechanism of deformation twinning observed in this study, but this study will shed light on studies of deformation twinning and dislocation substructures in the HEAs.",[],[]
5,Conclusions,"The evolution of deformation structures including twinning, and their contribution to the strain hardening of an equimolar CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy, were investigated using tensile-interrupted EBSD and TEM. The following conclusions were drawn:1)The HEA had a lower yield strength than the MEA because the addition of Mn weakens SSH in the HEA. Instead, the HEA exhibited higher strain hardening than the LEA and MEA. Its multiple-stage strain hardening behavior, resulting from deformation twinning, enhanced tensile strength and improved tensile elongation.2)In the interrupted tensile test, a high density of GNDs was generated near the grain boundaries and ATs. Also, intra-granular lattice curvatures (the plume-shaped features of GNDs) begun to develop in most of the grains with increasing tensile strain. At the necking strain, a considerable texture was characterized, in which the <111> directions were parallel to the tension axis, which is a typical of FCC metals. Moreover, the relationship between favorably oriented grains and twinning in the HEA bore a clear resemblance to the same tendency in TWIP steels3)The thickness of the twin bundles was less than 100nm. A high density of stacking defects was found in the developed nanotwins. The propagation of SFs along directions parallel to a TB are tied up due to the strong blockages caused by the nano TBs. Nano twinning and SFs increased strength and ductility.4)When deformation twinning occurred in preferential grains, equiaxed cell structures were further subdivided by the formation of MBs in the other grains. Deformation induced twinning not only had an effect on the dynamic Hall-Petch relationship but also changed the dislocation substructures of the HEA. In addition, deformation twinning might improve the post-necking strain of the HEA.",[],[]
