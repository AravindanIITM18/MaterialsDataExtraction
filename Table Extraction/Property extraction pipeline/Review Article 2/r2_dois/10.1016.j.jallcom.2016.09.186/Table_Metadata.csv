Ms denotes saturated magnetization, Hc for coercivity and Tc for the Curie temperature.","{'a': 'For the convenience of comparison, the magnetic units are unified. The Ms of FeCoNiAl0.2Si0.2 alloy is reported as 0.838-1.151 T by reference 11 and 26. According to the magnetic unit conversion table, 1 T = 104/4p emu/cm3 and 1 emu/cm3 /r (g/cm3) = 1/r emu/g. normally the alloy density r is between 6.5 g/cm3 to 7.5 g/cm3. Here, we use r = 7, so 0.838-1.151 T = 667-916 emu/cm3 = 95-131 emu/g. The magnetization of FeCoNiCrAl1.25 is also calculated according to the above equation.'}"
