0,Abstract,"The effect of thermo-mechanical processing on the evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties was investigated in an AlCoCrFeNi2.1 high entropy alloy. For this purpose, the alloy was cold-rolled to 90% reduction in thickness and annealed at temperatures ranging from 800°C to 1200°C. The as-cast alloy revealed eutectic lamellar mixture of (Ni, Al) rich but Cr depleted B2 phase and Al-depleted L12 phases, having volume fractions of ~35% and 65%, respectively. Nanosized precipitates enriched in Cr and having disordered BCC structure were found dispersed inside the B2 phase. Cold-rolling resulted in progressive disordering of the L12 phase but the B2 phase maintained the ordered structure. The disordering of the L12 phase was accompanied by the evolution of ultrafine lamellar structure and profuse shear band formation. Annealing of the 90% cold-rolled material at 800°C resulted in the formation of a duplex microstructure composed of two different phases with equiaxed morphologies, having significant resistance to grain growth up to 1200°C. The annealed materials showed disordered FCC and precipitate-free B2 phases. This indicated that quenching of the annealed specimens to room temperature was sufficient to prevent the ordering of the L12 phase and the formation of the Cr-rich nano-precipitates which were dissolved in the B2 phase during annealing. Significant improvement in tensile properties compared to the as-cast alloy could be achieved by thermo-mechanical processing. All the specimens annealed at 800°C to 1200°C were having good tensile ductility over 10% as well as high tensile strength greater than 1000MPa. These indicated that the properties of the EHEA could be successfully tailored using thermo-mechanical processing for a wide range of engineering applications.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High entropy alloys (HEAs) are a rapidly emerging class of advanced multicomponent alloys, originally developed using the novel alloy design philosophy of mixing five or more elements in equiatomic or near equiatomic proportions[1]. In spite of the presence of a large number of components, HEAs may show simple phases such as FCC, BCC and FCC+BCC[1,2]. At the early stages of development, it has been conceived that high configurational entropy of large number elements can decrease the free energy sufficiently to stabilize HEAs with simple solid solution structures. However, recent research results have shown that equiatomic HEAs with the same number but different combination of elements may result in the formation of multiple phases including intermetallic compounds[3], whereas non-equiatomic alloys can exist as simple solid solution phases[4]. These results indicate that high configurational entropy is not enough to completely explain the phase formation in the HEAs. Thus, the definition and robust criteria for predicting phase formation in multicomponent HEAs remain to be clarified. Despite the lack of clarity and ongoing debate with regard to the above aspects, the research in HEAs has received unprecedented attention in recent years[2,5–8]. Many unique and intriguing mechanical properties have been reported in different HEAs[5,6,9,10].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"It is envisaged that multiphase HEAs having a mixture of soft and hard phases can achieve the right balance of strength and ductility desired in many engineering applications. In order to meet these objectives, design of a non-equiatomic eutectic AlCoCrFeNi2.1HEA (EHEA) with two-phase lamellar microstructure and high strength has been first proposed by Lu et al.[11]. Several HEAs with multiphase lamellar microstructures have subsequently been reported[12,13].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"It is expected that thermo-mechanical processing comprising of plastic deformation and heat treatments can help tailoring properties of the EHEAs, as observed in the case of single phase HEAs, such as CoCrFeMnNi[14]. The changes in microstructure and mechanical properties during thermo-mechanical processing of EHEAs have been investigated only to a very limited extent[12,15]. Development of ultrafine microstructure and improvement in tensile properties compared to the as-cast material have been observed in AlCoCrFeNi2.1eutectic HEA by Wani et al.[15]. However, detailed microstructural investigation of deformation and annealing behavior have not been studied[15]. In contrast, deterioration in tensile properties due to structural coarsening has been reported in cold-rolled and annealed two-phase FeNiMnAlCr lamellar alloy[12]. While very high compressive strength has been reported in the eutectic lamellar CoCrFeNiNbXHEA, the tensile properties and effect of thermo-mechanical processing have not been made clear[13].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"It may thus be quite apparent that, thermo-mechanical processing behavior of lamellar multiphase HEAs needs to be studied in depth for tailoring their superior properties. In the present work, the development of microstructure and mechanical properties in an AlCoCrFeNi2.1eutectic HEA after heavy cold-rolling and annealing at different temperatures have been systematically investigated for tailoring their microstructure and mechanical properties. It is envisaged that the present work will also be useful in developing strategies for enhancing properties of other lamellar HEAs using thermo-mechanical processing.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"The experimental alloy AlCoCrFeNi2.1was prepared by arc-melting in a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere using high purity constituent metals (≥99.9%). In order to achieve high quality melt with good chemical homogeneity, the melting was repeated at least five times. The molten alloy was suction-cast into a copper mold having inner dimensions of 15mm (width)×90mm (length)×3mm (thickness). Specimens with dimensions 20mm (long)×15mm (width)×3mm (thickness)) were obtained from the as-cast material and the surfaces are carefully polished to remove any contamination. The specimens were deformed at room temperature by multi-pass unidirectional cold-rolling to ~90% reduction in thickness (final thickness ~300µm). A laboratory scale two-high rolling equipment (SPX Precision Instruments, Fenn Division, USA) having 140mm diameter rolls was used for this purpose. In order to understand the deformation behavior, samples for microstructural observations were obtained from the cold-rolled sheets after ~10%, 20%, 50% and 90% reduction in thickness.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"Small specimens obtained from the 90% cold-rolled sheets were annealed for 1h (h) at temperatures ranging from 800°C to 1200°C. The annealed samples were immediately water quenched following the annealing treatments. Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) system (Oxford Instruments, UK) attached to a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (Carl-Zeiss, Germany; Model: SUPRA 40), and transmission electron microscope (TEM) (JEOL 2010 operated at 200kV) were employed for microstructural characterization. The chemical analyses of different phases were carried out using an energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) system attached to a JEOL 2100F TEM operated at 200kV. The samples for EBSD and TEM investigations were prepared using mechanical polishing followed by electropolishing (electrolyte: 90% ethanol +10% perchloric acid). Tensile properties were determined at ambient temperature using a floor mounted universal testing machine (Shimadzu, Japan). Tensile specimens with gage length of 2mm, width of 1mm and thickness of 0.3mm were tested using an initial strain rate of 8.3×10−4s−1.",[],[]
3,Results," Fig. 1 shows the microstructure of the as-cast AlCoCrFeNi2.1. The phase map of the as-cast material ( Fig. 1(a) ) clearly reveals an eutectic lamellar morphology. The as-cast microstructure consists of ordered FCC (L12; highlighted in green in Fig. 1(a) ) and ordered BCC (B2; highlighted in red in Fig. 1(a) ) phases having average volume fractions of ~65% and 35%, respectively, as has been reported in our previous work[15]. The as-cast eutectic morphology is further revealed in the TEM micrograph ( Fig. 1(b) ) which shows thicker L12(gray regions marked by green circles, having average thickness ~0.57µm) and B2 (white regions marked by red circles, having average thickness ~0.20µm) lamellae. The distributions of different constituent elements in the microstructure determined by TEM EDS are shown in Fig. 1(c)  through Fig. 1(e)  and tabulated in Table 1 in a quantitative manner. The EDS maps of Fe ( Fig. 1(a) ) and Co ( Fig. 1(b) ) show rather homogenous distribution. However, it is clearly observed that the B2 phase is depleted in Cr ( Fig. 1(e) ) but enriched in Al ( Fig. 1(f) ) and Ni ( Fig. 1(g) . The converse is found true for the L12phase.","['f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005']",['t0005']
3,Results,"The detailed TEM analysis also reveals the presence of profuse spherical precipitates with nano-size inside the B2 phase ( Fig. 2(a) ). The SADPs obtained from the matrix and the precipitate are shown in Fig. 2(b)  and (c), respectively. The SADP of the matrix ( Fig. 2(b) ) clearly shows superlattice reflections (marked by red circles) confirming the ordered B2 structure, as has been reported earlier[15]. Interestingly, the SADP obtained from the nano-precipitates ( Fig. 2(c) ) does not show any superlattice reflections but [011] BCC pattern, thus confirming their disordered BCC structure. The elemental distribution maps ( Fig. 2(d) –(h)) clearly show that the precipitates are significantly enriched in Cr ( Fig. 2(c) ). This is also clearly understood from Table 1 .","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010']",['t0005']
3,Results," Fig. 3 shows the gradual development of deformation microstructure during cold-rolling. The TEM observations were carried out from the transverse section (TD) of the rolled sheets, and all diffraction patterns were obtained from the [011] zone of the L12/FCC and B2 phases. The micrograph after 10% rolling reduction ( Fig. 3(a) ) shows the retention of the eutectic lamellar morphology. The superlattice reflections (marked by red circle) in the SADP ( Fig. 3(b) ) obtained from the green circle position in the micrograph in Fig. 3(a)  clearly shows ordered L12phase. The superlattice reflections (marked by red circles) in the SADP in Fig. 3(b)  obtained from the other phase (marked by the red circle position in Fig. 3(a) ) clearly show the presence of the B2 phase. Development of dislocation networks inside the L12(marked by green circle in Fig. 3(a) ) and B2 phases (marked by red circle in Fig. 3(a) ) could be observed. The eutectic morphology is also observed after cold-rolling to 20% reduction in thickness ( Fig. 3(d) ). The SADPs shown in Fig. 3(e)  (obtained from the region circled by green in Fig. 3(d) ) and (f) (obtained from the region circled by red in Fig. 3(d) ) correspond to the L12and B2 phases, respectively. Extensive dislocation network is developed in the L12phase and also observed in the B2 phase. The microstructure after 50% cold-rolling ( Fig. 3(g) ) continues to show the eutectic morphology and high density of dislocations. The SADP shown in Fig. 3(h)  obtained from the green circled region in Fig. 3(g)  shows the absence of the superlattice reflections associated with the L12phase indicating disordering of the L12into FCC. In contrast, the extra reflections in the SADP (marked by red circle) shown in Fig. 3(i)  obtained from the region marked by red circle in Fig. 3(g)  shows retention of the B2 phase.","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']",[]
3,Results,"The eutectic morphology could not be observed after 90% cold-rolling when viewed along the normal direction (ND) of the rolled sheet ( Fig. 4(a) ). The microstructure appears to be rather diffuse, characterized by the presence of high density of dislocations. A ring like diffraction pattern ( Fig. 4(b) ) obtained from the FCC region (marked by green circle in Fig. 4(a) ) reveals the evolution of an ultrafine microstructure within the selected region. On the other hand, the SADP ( Fig. 4(c) ) taken from the red circle region in Fig. 4(a)  shows a clear [001] pattern. The extra reflections (marked by red circle) in the SADP shown in Fig. 4(c)  confirm the retention of the B2 phase even after heavy cold-rolling. A TEM micrograph obtained from the B2 region ( Fig. 4(d) ) shows closely spaced Cr-rich nano-precipitates (inset in Fig. 4(d)  shows a magnified view for clarity), indicating their stability during deformation. Fig. 4(e)  shows the microstructure of the disordered FCC phase in the 90% cold-rolled material observed from the TD. Development of a finely subdivided ultrafine lamellar structure (average lamellar spacing ~25nm) is observed.

3,Results,"The development of microstructure after annealing of the 90% cold-rolled material is investigated using TEM ( Fig. 5 ) and EBSD ( Fig. 6 ) for the purpose of identifying the constituent phases and evaluating the key microstructural parameters. The TEM micrograph of the specimen annealed at 800°C ( Fig. 5(a) ) shows recrystallized ultrafine grains. The SADPs shown in Fig. 5(b)  (obtained from the green circled region in Fig. 5(a) ) and (c) (obtained from the red circled region in Fig. 5(a) ) clearly show the presence of disordered FCC and ordered B2 phases, respectively. The large area EBSD phase map of the 800°C annealed sample ( Fig. 6(a) ) shows a microduplex structure composed of the two phases with equiaxed morphology. The phase map also reveals profuse annealing twins inside the FCC phase (the twin boundaries are highlighted in yellow) which is also confirmed from the corresponding TEM image ( Fig. 5(a) ).","['f0025', 'f0030', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0030', 'f0025']",[]
3,Results,"The TEM micrographs of the specimens annealed at 1000°C ( Fig. 5(d) ) and 1200°C ( Fig. 5(g) ) show very similar microduplex structures, which are confirmed from the corresponding EBSD phase maps shown in Fig. 6(b)  and (c), respectively. The SADPs obtained from the constituent phases (indicated by green and red circles in Fig. 5(d)  and (g)) in these annealed materials clearly reveal the presence of disordered FCC (SADPs shown in Fig. 5(e)  and (h)) and B2 (SADPs shown in Fig. 5(f)  and (i)) phases. Notably, the nanosized precipitates which are present in the B2 phase in the as-cast and cold-rolled conditions, could not be observed after annealing. This is also shown in Fig. 7(a)  which shows a B2 grain (marked by red circle) in the specimen annealed at 800°C and corresponding EDS maps of the area showing distributions of elements of interest, namely Cr ( Fig. 7(b) ), Al ( Fig. 7(c) ) and Ni ( Fig. 7(d) ). It is clearly observed that the B2 phase remains enriched in (Ni, Al) but depleted in Cr. Absence of Cr clusters corresponding to BCC precipitates suggests that the precipitates are dissolved during annealing above 800°C.","['f0025', 'f0025', 'f0030', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035']",[]
3,Results,Key microstructural parameters of the specimens 90% cold-rolled and then annealed at different temperatures for 1h are shown in Fig. 8 . The phase fraction plot ( Fig. 8(a) ) shows that the L12/FCC phase fraction increases consistently while that of the B2 phase decreases with increasing annealing temperature. Fig. 8(b)  shows that the average grain sizes of the two phases increase rather slowly with increasing the annealing temperature. The difference in the average grain size of the two phases is not quite significant in each annealed condition ( Fig. 8(b) ).,"['f0040', 'f0040', 'f0040', 'f0040']",[]
3,Results,"The tensile stress-strain plots of the EHEA in different conditions are shown in Fig. 9 , and the mechanical properties summarized in Table 2 . The as-cast alloy shows continuous yielding followed by strain-hardening. The yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation to failure (ef) are ~620MPa, ~1050MPa and~17%, respectively. 90% Cold-rolling leads to a drastic increase in strength (YS: 1625MPa, UTS:1800MPa) but the ductility is significantly sacrificed (ef :6%). Annealing of the 90% cold-rolled material at different temperatures restores the ductility at the expense of the strength. It is clearly seen that the elongation to failure increases while strength decreases systematically with increasing the annealing temperature. The materials annealed at 800°C and 1000°C show higher strength than the as-cast material, whereas annealing at 1200°C leads to a reduction in strength. It is interesting to note that the materials annealed at 800°C and 1000°C also show discontinuous yielding characterized by clear yield drop. Such discontinuous yielding has been reported in a wide variety of ultrafine-grained microstructures[16–19].",['f0045'],['t0010']
4,Discussion,"The detailed TEM analysis of the as-cast alloy in the present study has shown the presence of ordered L12and B2 phases. The chemical analysis has confirmed that the L12phase is depleted in Al while the B2 phase is enriched with Ni and Al. It is observed for the AlXCoCrFeNi system[20]that single phase FCC phase is formed for x<0.5 (11.1at%) while single phase BCC is observed for x>0.9 (20at%). A mixture of FCC and BCC is found in the intermediate range (i.e. between 11.1at% to 20at%)[20]. It has been considered that the stabilization of BCC phases by the addition of Al on BCC phases is attributed to the large atomic diameter of Al, so that the more open structure of BCC phases is favored in order to reduce the lattice distortion[21]. The development of a two phase microstructure agrees with the nominal Al content of the present AlCoCrFeNi2.1alloy (16.39at%). According to the valence electron concentration model proposed by Guo et al.[22], FCC phase is stabilized for VEC≥8.0 while the BCC phases is favored for VEC<6.87. In the intermediate range, a two phase microstructure could be expected. The observed two phase microstructure is also consistent with the calculated VEC of 7.70 for the present alloy.",[],[]
4,Discussion,"While the formation of the ordered L12structure is at variance with previously reported lamellar two phase HEAs showing presence of a disordered FCC phase[12,13], the ordered B2 phase has been reported frequently[12,23,24]possibly owing to the strong negative enthalpy associated with the formation of the B2 structure in the Al–Ni system[20,25]. The composition of the present B2 phase with ~45at% Ni ( Table 1 ) further indicates that one of the lattice sites in B2 unit cell is preferentially occupied by Ni atoms while other positions are shared by Al and other elements (Co, Cr, Fe). The presence of disordered BCC nano-precipitates inside the B2 phase is observed in the Al1.5CoCrFeNi[20], Al1.5CoCrFeNi[26]and AlCoCrCuFeNi[27]HEAs, presumably due to spinodal decomposition originating from compositional modulations[28,29]. The present study has confirmed that the BCC nano-precipitates are Cr rich.",[],['t0005']
4,Discussion,"The interesting feature of the deformation behavior of the present EHEA is the gradual disordering of the L12phase. The disordering phenomenon has been extensively reported in L12structured Ni3Al during processing by cold-rolling[30], high pressure torsion[31–33]and ball milling[34]. The passage of perfect or pair of dissociated super-dislocations preserves the ordered structure as the disordered structure introduced by the leading partial dislocation is removed by the trailing one. As a result, the disordering is attributed to the uncoupling of the partial dislocations during deformation, which is also supported by experimental evidences in a few cases[35]. Ball et al. have observed increase in the density of deformation heterogeneities, such as microbands, with increasing rolling reduction[30]and extensive shear band formation[36]after heavy cold-rolling in a B doped Ni3Al . The authors have concluded that dislocation activities solely could not account for the disordering and contributions of microbands and shear bands should be more important[30]. Well-developed shear bands in the 90% cold-rolled EHEA is clearly revealed by TEM in the present study ( Fig. 4(e) ). Careful EBSD investigations in this alloy by the present authors have also confirmed the presence of numerous shear bands which finely fragment the microstructure[15]. The apparent similarities in the microstructural development of the present alloy and Ni3Al+B indicate a possible role of deformation heterogeneities in the disordering process.",['f0020'],[]
4,Discussion,"The recrystallization behaviors in different ordered intermetallic alloys have been studied extensively in the past[37]. It has been confirmed that the recrystallization behavior is greatly affected by several factors including starting material (i.e., ordered or disordered) and annealing temperatures[37]. Rapid restoration of the ordered structure from cold-rolled disordered material during annealing below the critical temperature (Tc) has been reported[38]. Further, the kinetics of ordering below the TCcan show very different behavior. For intermetallic phases such as Cu3Au, the disordered state cannot be retained at room temperature by simple quenching from temperature above TCdue to rapid ordering[39]. In contrast, the disordered state can be retained at room temperature by simple quenching in intermetallic FeCo after quenching due to the sluggish ordering kinetics[39].",[],[]
4,Discussion,"The behavior of the present alloy can now be explained with regard to the above observations mentioned above. In the present study, the cold-rolled material consisting of the disordered FCC and B2 phases maintains these phases after annealing. Thus, the disordered FCC phase formed during cold-rolling does not undergo ordering during annealing, indicating that the lowest annealing temperature in the present case i.e. 800°C is likely higher than the TCfor the L12phase. Evidence for this observation is found when the annealing is carried out at a lower temperature of 700°C for 1h in Fig. 10 . Fig. 10(a)  is the TEM micrograph of an unrecrystallized region The presence of ordered L12phase confirmed by the weak superlattice reflections marked by red circles in the SADP ( Fig. 10(b) ) obtained from the green circled region in Fig. 10(a) . The results suggest that TCfor the L12phase is in the present alloy is between 700°C and 800°C. On the other hand, the SADP ( Fig. 10(d) ) obtained from the recrystallized grain in Fig. 10(c)  (marked by arrow) clearly reveals the disordered FCC structure without extra spots. Fig. 10(a)  and (b) indicate that ordering from the cold-rolled disordered material is occurring. The origin of the ordered L12is due to the ordering of the disordered FCC phase of the cold-rolled material. However, before ordering completes, recrystallization initiates from the disordered regions. It is reasonable that no recrystallized grains are observed in the ordered regions, since recrystallization of ordered phases is usually slower than that in disordered phase. This is also indicative of the fact that the ordering kinetics from FCC to L12in the present alloy is rather slow. The slower ordering kinetics is amply corroborated by the fact that the disordered FCC phase is retained at room temperature after simple quenching from the annealing temperatures above 800°C.","['f0050', 'f0050', 'f0050', 'f0050', 'f0050', 'f0050', 'f0050']",[]
4,Discussion,"The ordered structure of the B2 phase is observed even after 90% cold-rolling and in the annealed samples quenched from the annealing temperature above 800°C. This observation is remarkably similar to lamellar FeNiMnAlCr HEA which shows stable B2 phase after cold-rolling and annealing[12]. The presence of the B2 phase in the annealed samples indicates two possibilities. Firstly, the recrystallized B2 grains originated from the cold-rolled B2 phase, indicating that this phase has a very high TCor can retain the ordered structure even up to the eutectic melting point. The second possibility is that the B2 phase formed during quenching due to the rapid ordering kinetics from the corresponding disordered phase existing at the annealing temperatures above TC. It is not possible to confirm which possibility is correct and further work needs to be carried out. Importantly, the B2 phase in the annealed specimens does not include the Cr-rich nano-precipitates, which are clearly observed in the as-cast ( Fig. 2 ) and heavily cold-rolled ( Fig. 4(d) ) conditions. Evidently, the nano-precipitates are dissolved completely even during annealing at 800°C ( Fig. 7 ), which indicates that solubility limit of Cr-rich precipitates is at least below 800°C. The quenching of the annealed specimens down to room temperature seems sufficient to suppress the decomposition.","['f0010', 'f0020', 'f0035']",[]
4,Discussion,"The change of the lamellar deformation structure in the heavily cold-rolled specimen to equiaxed ultrafine microduplex structures after annealing is rather similar to the microstructural changes observed in heavily warm-rolled duplex stainless steel (DSS)[40]. Development of the ultrafine recrystallized microstructure is indicative of nucleation dominant but growth suppressed process, which has been reported in single phase[41], multiphase[42]and lamellar HEAs[12]. Evidently, the duplex ultrafine microstructure shows very limited grain growth even after annealing at 1200°C, since the two phases show mean grain size of ~2µm ( Fig. 8(b) ). The eutectic temperature (Tm) determined from the DSC measurement of this alloy is ~1350°C[11], so that the annealing temperature of 1200°C corresponds to 0.91 Tm. Therefore, the alloy evidently shows excellent resistance to grain growth or microstructural coarsening at least up to a temperature of ~0.91 Tm, which is considerably greater than conventional alloys but has been sometimes observed in HEAs[41]. It has been argued that the resistance to grain growth is attributed to sluggish diffusion in multicomponent HEAs[43,44]. In addition, it is typical in duplex microstructure that growth of one phase can be significantly retarded by the presence of the other phase[40].",['f0040'],[]
4,Discussion,"It is observed that the fractions of the two constituent phases change with increasing the annealing temperature ( Fig. 8(a) ). The increase in the fraction of the L12phase with increasing the annealing temperature is accompanied by the decrease in the fraction of the B2 phase. Such a behavior is often observed in duplex materials such as α+γ DSS[40]and α+β brass[39], where the phase fractions are determined by the phase diagram of the alloy at the corresponding temperatures.",['f0040'],[]
4,Discussion,"It is well known that the conventional alloys in as-cast condition usually show poor mechanical properties. Contrary to this, the present alloy shows good strength and ductility even in the as-cast condition ( Fig. 9 ). This is presumably attributed to the presence of the ultrafine eutectic microstructure. The remarkable increase in strength in the cold-rolled condition is consistent with the microstructural refinement down to nanoscale and strain-hardening resulting from heavy cold-rolling. Annealing restores ductility at the expense of strength, as expected ( Fig. 9 ). It should be noted, however, the grain size of the two phases after annealing at 800°C and 1000°C are greater than the corresponding lamellar thickness in the as-cast material ( Fig. 8(b) ). Despite coarsening, increase in strength is clearly observed in the specimens annealed at 800°C or 1000°C. This is probably because of the increased volume fraction of the B2 phase that is usually a hard phase[12]compared to that in the as-cast material ( Fig. 8(a) ) and the change in microstructure from eutectic lamellae into equiaxed microduplex structure after annealing. The duplex morphology results in well significant increase in the density of the interphase boundaries throughout the microstructure which act as effective barriers to the motion of dislocations. The observed decrease in strength after annealing at 1200°C as compared to the material annealed at 1000°C is in good agreement with rather similar volume fractions of the B2 phase but slightly coarser grain size in the former. It is important to note that all the specimens annealed at 800°C to 1200°C have good tensile ductility over 10% as well as high tensile strength greater than 1000MPa ( Table 2 ). It can be concluded that present EHEA processed by conventional 90% cold-rolling and subsequent annealing develops variety of mechanical properties suitable for different kinds of engineering applications. Evidently the present EHEA can be developed as a novel structural material managing both high strength and good ductility.","['f0045', 'f0045', 'f0040', 'f0040']",['t0010']
4,Discussion,"The discontinuous yielding observed in materials annealed at 800°C and 1000°C has been reported in a wide range of ultrafine grained materials[16–19]and consistent with the ultrafine or near ultrafine microstructure observed in two annealed conditions of the present EHEA. Such discontinuous yielding characterized by obvious yield-drop has been reported in conventional metals and alloys having single phase ultrafine-grained (UFG) microstructures, such as commercial purity (99%) aluminum[45,46], high-purity (99.99%) aluminum[47], pure copper[48,49], Cu–Al alloy[49], pure titanium[18], pure magnesium[50], ultra-low carbon interstitial free steel[45], high-manganese austenitic steels[19], and so on. Those materials usually show continuous yielding where it is difficult to distinguish when the yielding (the transition from elastic deformation to plastic deformation) occurs when they have conventionally coarse grain sizes, but discontinuous yielding sometimes accompanied by Luders band deformation[45–47]happens when the grain size is reduced down to 1–2µm. It is interesting that such a characteristic discontinuous yielding of UFG materials has been observed in various pure metals[18,45–51]as well as alloys[18,19,49,50], regardless of crystal structures, i.e., FCC[19,45–49], BCC[45]and HCP[18,50,51]. The present result is possibly the first report showing the discontinuous yielding in UFG duplex microstructure composed of FCC and B2 phases. The mechanism of discontinuous yielding in UFG materials is still unclear, but the present result supports that discontinuous yielding is an intrinsic feature of the UFG metallic materials.",[],[]
4,Discussion,"The improvement in the mechanical properties in the present alloy due to thermo-mechanical processing can be compared with the recently investigated FeNiMnAlCr lamellar two phase HEA[12]. The YS and UTS of the FeNiMnAlCr alloy decreased after cold-rolling and annealing at 650°C as compared to those in the as-cast state due to structural coarsening[12]. In contrast, thermo-mechanical processing on the present EHEA allows tailoring nano/microstructures and mechanical properties to achieve a remarkable strength-ductility balance.",[],[]
5,Conclusions,"(i)The AlCoCrFeNi2.1EHEA shows a mixture of L12and B2 phases in the as-cast state. The B2 phase is enriched in Ni and Al but depleted in Cr. In contrast, the L12phase is depleted in Al. Nano-sized precipitates enriched in (Ni, Cr) are found inside the B2 phase.(ii)The alloy can be extensively cold-rolled at room temperature up to 90% without cracks. The L12phase undergoes disordering during the rolling deformation while the B2 phase maintains the ordered structure. Extensive shear band formation in the L12phase indicates a possible role of heterogeneous deformation (shear banding) in the disordering process.(iii)90% Cold-rolled material annealed at different temperatures from 800°C to 1200°C shows the presence of disordered FCC and B2 phases. This indicates that the disordered FCC phase can be retained by simple quenching, presumably due to the sluggish ordering kinetics from the FCC phase to the L12phase. Slight increase in the FCC fraction is observed with concomitant decrease in the B2 fraction with increasing the annealing temperature. The Cr-rich nano-precipitates are not observed within the B2 phase as they are dissolved in the B2 phase during annealing and quenching prevents the decomposition of B2.(iv)Microduplex ultrafine microstructures with equiaxed grain morphologies are observed after annealing at 800°C with exceptional resistance to grain growth even up to annealing temperature of 1200°C. The resistance to grain growth is attributed to the sluggish diffusion in HEAs and the duplex morphology.(v)Significant enhancement in mechanical properties compared with the as-cast material is observed after thermo-mechanical processing. All the specimens annealed at 800°C to 1200°C show appreciable tensile ductility over 10% as well as high tensile strength greater than 1000MPa. These indicated that the properties of the EHEA could be successfully tailored using thermo-mechanical processing for a wide variety of engineering applications.",[],[]
