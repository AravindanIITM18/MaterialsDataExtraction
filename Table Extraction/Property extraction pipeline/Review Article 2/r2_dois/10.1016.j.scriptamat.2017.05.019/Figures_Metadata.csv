f0005,articles_test/10.1016.j.scriptamat.2017.05.019/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,Representative room-temperature engineering stress-strain curves for the (a) homogenized and recrystallized Mo10alloys and (b) Mo5alloys. (c) Variation of strain hardening rates of Mo10and Mo5alloys with plastic strain. (d) Yield strength versus elongation to fracture of current Mo10and Mo5alloys compared with various HEAs.
f0010,articles_test/10.1016.j.scriptamat.2017.05.019/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,"(a) TEM bright-field image of homogenized Mo10alloy, showing clustered μ phases. (b) and (c) SAED patterns of the μ phase along the [101−0] and [112−3] zone axes, respectively. (d) EDS spectra of FCC phase and μ phase. (e) XRD patterns of homogenized and recrystallized Mo10HEAs."
f0015,articles_test/10.1016.j.scriptamat.2017.05.019/figures/gr3.jpg,Fig. 3,"TEM images of Mo10HEAs that were hot-, cold-rolled and subsequently annealed at (a)–(c) 5min annealing at 800°C, 900°C and 1000°C, and then water quenching; (d)–(f) 1h annealing at 800°C, 900°C and 1000°C, and then air cooling. Narrow and straight bands correspond to annealing twins. Black domains correspond to μ phases, and are primarily located at boundaries (grain boundary and twin boundary). (g) Variation of average size of μ phase precipitates with annealing condition, and (h) Variation of numbers of μ phase precipitates with annealing condition."
f0020,articles_test/10.1016.j.scriptamat.2017.05.019/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,"TEM bright-field images of annealed Mo10alloy at tension strain of 15%, showing the interaction of dislocations with nanoscale μ precipitates, (a) Pile-up of dislocations at interfaces and (b) bow-out of gliding dislocations. (c) Dislocations interactions in Mo10HEAs that are annealed at high temperature of 1150°C. (d) Deformation nanotwins in Mo10alloy at tension strain of 25%."
