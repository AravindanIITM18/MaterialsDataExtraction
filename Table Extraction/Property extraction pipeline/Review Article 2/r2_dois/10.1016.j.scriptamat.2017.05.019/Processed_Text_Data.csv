0,Abstract,"Non-equiatomic Cr15Fe20Co35Ni20Mo10 (Mo10) high-entropy alloys (HEAs) are produced by arc-melting and subsequent thermal-mechanical processing. The single-phase Mo10 HEAs with face centered cubic (FCC) structure exhibit an exceptional ductility and strain hardening capability associated with twinning. Tailoring thermal-mechanical processing condition enables the evolvement of single-phase Mo10 HEAs to multiphase microstructure that comprises simple FCC solid solution and nanoscale precipitates of Mo-rich μ phase. These precipitates primarily grow at grain boundaries and twin boundaries, strengthening Mo10 HEAs. This work sheds light on realizing a superb strength-ductility combination of HEAs by coupling solid solution hardening, nanotwinning and precipitation hardening mechanisms.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs) that are composed of five or more elements in an equiatomic or near-equiatomic composition have attracted increasing attentions because of their unique compositions, microstructures, and adjustable properties[1–6]. According to the structure (simple/complex) and ordering (ordered/disordered) of phases, HEAs are classified into three types: simple disordered phase, simple ordered phase and complex ordered phase[3]. Simple structures are the most frequently seen in as-cast HEAs, and generally refer to solid solutions of simple face-centered cubic (FCC), body-centered cubic (BCC), or hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures[7–10]. Besides simple phases, different kinds of complex ordered phases, such as σ, μ, Laves, etc., are also observed in HEAs[11–14]. These complex ordered phases strengthen HEAs while often decrease their ductility. However, it has been demonstrated experimentally that manipulating the shape, dimension and distribution of strengthening units, e.g. hard and brittle particles, fibers, and precipitates, can optimize the strength and ductility of structural materials[15–18]. For example, nanoscale precipitate or lamina can plastically co-deform with matrix associated with dislocations transmission across the strengthening unit[17,18].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"HEAs with single phase FCC structure generally exhibit low yield strength but superb ductility and strain hardening capability[1,2]. Plastic deformation of FCC HEAs (for example of Co-Cr-Fe-Ni system plus one or two other elements) is accommodated by slip of 1/2 〈110〉 type dislocations on {111} planes and/or twinning associated with successive gliding of 1/6 〈112〉 type dislocations on {111} planes[19,20]. Deformation twinning generates twin boundaries that block dislocation motion and further strengthen materials (referred to as twin boundary strengthening mechanism)[21,22]. Besides boundary strengthening associated with grain refinement and twinning, FCC HEAs can be strengthened through adjusting elements and their composition ratio corresponding to solid solution hardening mechanism[23,24]and precipitation hardening mechanism[25]. In this work, we aim to optimize strengthen and ductility of Cr-Fe-Co-Ni-Mo HEAs by coupling the three strengthening mechanisms.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"We fabricate a series of non-equiatomic Cr20−xFe20Co20+3xNi20Mo20−2xHEAs. The Cr-Fe-Co-Ni-Mo system is chosen for this study because Cr-Fe-Co-Ni HEAs are FCC phase solid solutions[26,27]. Although the role of each element in developing microstructure and changing mechanical properties of HEAs is not understood comprehensively, previous study of Cr-Fe-Co-Ni system provides valuable guidance of designing the composition ratio of Cr-Fe-Co-Ni HEAs[28,29,30]. For example, equiatomic CoCrNi alloys[28,29]that have low stacking fault energy exhibit superior mechanical properties (good ductility and toughness) compared to equimolar CoCrFeMnNi due to the earlier onset of twinning[31,32]. Therefore, adjusting Cr concentration may achieve low stacking fault energy of {111} planes and promote twin boundary strengthening effect. To promote solid solution hardening and precipitation hardening effects, we simultaneously adjust the concentration of Mo and Co elements. Lattice distortion due to size misfit of atoms impedes dislocation movement and leads to the pronounced solid solution strengthening. For example, increasing concentration of Al (larger radius than others) in AlxCrFeCoNi HEAs significantly increases yield and flow strength of the HEAs[33]. Among the five elements in Cr-Fe-Co-Ni-Mo system, Mo has the largest metallic radius (Ni (0.124nm), Co (0.125nm), Fe (0.126nm), Cr (0.128nm), Mo (0.139nm)), and thus potentially maximizes solid solution strengthening. In addition, Mo has been demonstrated to facilitate formation of hard and brittle intermetallic phases in AlCoCrFeNiMo and AlCrFeNiMo alloys[34,35]. Interestingly, increasing the concentration of Co may inhibit the formation of intermetallic phases in (FeNiCrMn)(100−x)CoxHEAs[36]. Therefore, we hypothesize that optimizing the composition ratio of Cr, Co and Mo simultaneously may develop Cr20−xFe20Co20+3xNi20Mo20−2xHEAs with superb mechanical properties.",[],[]
2,Experimental methods,"Alloy ingots with nominal compositions of Cr20−xFe20Co20+3xNi20Mo20−2x(x=0, 2.5, 5, 7.5at.%) are prepared by arc-melting under an argon atmosphere, subsequently homogenized in vacuum at 1200°C for 48h and then cooled in the furnace. Purity of the raw materials is greater than 99.9%. The synthesized HEAs are referred to as Homogenized-HEAs. The homogenized HEA ingots are further hot-rolled at 1100°C to the sheet with a thickness of 8mm, then cold-rolled to 2.4mm with a thickness reduction of 70%, followed by annealing at various conditions, 800°C for 5min then water quenching (WQ), 800°C for 1h then air cooling (AC), 850°C for 5min then water quenching, 900°C and 1000°C for 5min then water quenching, 1000°C and 1150°C for 1h then air cooling. The HEAs that are treated through such thermal-mechanical processing and annealing are referred to as Recrystallized-HEAs. Tension tests are conducted using an INSTRON-8801 instrument at room temperature with an engineering strain rate of 10−3s−1. Dog-bone-shaped tensile specimens with a gauge length of 18mm and width of 3mm are machined from homogenized and recrystallized sheets by electric discharge machining.",[],[]
2,Experimental methods,"The phase constitution of the alloys is examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Microstructure characterization is performed by optical microscope (OM) and JEM 2100F transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). OM specimens are initially polished to 5000-grit SiC paper and, subsequently, carefully polished down to 1.5μm diamond polishing compound, and etched with a solution that is composing of supersaturated copper sulfate, hydrochloric acid and alcohol. Two surfaces of tensile specimens are carefully polished with SiC paper, leading to a final specimen thickness of 1.5mm. Specimens for TEM observation are thinned using mechanical grinding followed by double-jet electropolishing in a solution of 6% perchloric acid, 35% n-butyl alcohol and 59% alcohol at −30°C and an applied voltage of 30V.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Mechanical properties,"Tension testing shows that homogenized Cr20−xFe20Co20+3xNi20Mo20−2xalloys as x=0 at.% and 2.5at.% (referred to as Mo20and Mo15HEAs, respectively) are extremely brittle without apparent plasticity. The XRD patterns and optical micrographs reveal that Mo20and Mo15HEAs contain σ phase networks in FCC matrix (Fig. S1 in Supplementary information), which is consistent with previous work[37,38]. With decreasing the concentration of Mo, homogenized Mo10and Mo5HEAs (corresponding to x=5 at.% and 7.5at.%) display good ductility. Fracture occurs at tension strain of 21.9% for Mo10and 55% for Mo5. However, homogenized Mo10and Mo5HEAs display a low yield and ultimate strength, as shown in Fig. 1 a and b. The XRD patterns and optical micrographs (Fig. S1) reveal that homogenized Mo10HEA is composing of FCC phase solid solution and less μ phase precipitates while homogenized Mo5HEA is simple FCC phase solid solution.",['f0005'],[]
3.1,Results.Mechanical properties,"Tensile testing of recrystallized Mo10and Mo5HEAs shows that thermo-mechanical processing and annealing significantly improve both yield and ultimate strengths of Mo10and Mo5HEAs ( Fig. 1 a and b). Fig. 1 c shows the variation of strain hardening rates with plastic strain. For Mo10alloys, homogenized Mo10alloy exhibits a yield strength (YS) of ~0.35GPa (corresponding to 0.2% offset yield stress), an ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of ~0.72GPa corresponding to an elongation (EL) to fracture of ~21.9%. After thermal-mechanical processing and annealing at 850–1000°C for 5 mins (WQ) or 1h (AC), recrystallized Mo10HEAs show a significant increase in both YS and UTS without the loss of ductility. Mo10HEAs annealed at 900°C for 5min reach YS=1.03GPa and UTS=1.25GPa, respectively, while remain a large ductility corresponding to the EL to fracture ~18.3%. Interestingly, recrystallized Mo10HEAs that is annealed at 1150°C show the same yield strength as homogenized Mo10while the ductility is significantly increased. The EL to fracture is 23% for homogenized one and 63% for recrystallized Mo10HEAs. Fig. 1 c shows that Mo10HEAs annealed at 850–1000°C exhibit higher strain hardening rate than Mo5HEAs and Mo10HEA annealed at 1150°C as the true strain is less than half the maximum elongation; strain hardening rate of Mo10HEAs annealed at 1150°C is lower than other Mo10HEAs and similar to that of Mo5HEAs in the early stage of deformation. The high strain hardening rate in Mo10HEAs annealed at 850–1000°C is ascribed to the formation of distributed μ phase precipitates while the low strain hardening rate in Mo10HEAs annealed at 1150°C is due to the decomposition and disappearance of clustered μ phase precipitates. This will be discussed in the following sections. Fig. 1 d compares the YS and EL of various FCC HEAs. Mo10and Mo5HEAs exhibit exceptional combination of strength and ductility. Mo10HEAs have high strength (YS=0.8–1.3GPa and UTS=1.1–1.4GPa) but moderate ductility (EL is around 13–28%). Mo5HEAs have superb ductility (EL is around 45–75%) but moderate strength (YS=0.3–0.8GPa and UTS=0.7–1.0GPa). This is ascribed to the single-phase FCC solid solution (Fig. S2 in Supplementary information). Mechanical properties of both Mo5and Mo10HEAs are much better than other FCC HEAs[6,19,24,25,26,39–46].","['f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3.1,Results.Mechanical properties,"Unlike single-phase Mo5HEAs, Mo10HEAs consist of FCC phase solid solution and μ phase precipitates. More importantly, the distribution and dimension of μ phase precipitates are controllable through adjusting thermal-mechanical processing and annealing condition. TEM bright-field images of homogenized Mo10HEAs in Fig. 2 ashows clustered precipitates with the average size of 1.8μm. The selected area diffraction (SAED) patterns of the precipitate that are taken along the [101−0] and [112−3] zone axes, as shown in Fig. 2 b and c, confirm that the precipitate adopts hexagonal close packed structure with the lattice parameters of a≈4.76Å and c≈8.54Å. Thus these precipitates are identified to be μ phase. Chemical compositions of the μ phase and FCC matrix are analyzed using EDX, as shown in Fig. 2 d. The average chemical compositions of two phases are calculated based on at least three independent EDX measurements. The results are summarized in Table 1 . It can be seen that the concentration of Mo is substantially higher in μ phase than in FCC matrix.","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010']",['t0005']
3.1,Results.Mechanical properties,"XRD patterns of Mo10HEAs in Fig. 2 e display several peaks that correspond to μ phases. After annealing at 800°C for 1h or 850°C for 5min or 900°C for 5min or 1000°C for 1h, the peak intensity of μ phases is stronger than that in homogenized Mo10HEAs, but decreases with the increase of annealing temperature. When the hot- and cold-rolled Mo10HEAs are annealed at high temperature of 1150°C, the peaks of μ phases disappear, implying the formation of a single-phase FCC structure. Correspondingly, the recrystallized Mo10HEAs annealed at 1150°C show the same, low strength as the homogenized Mo10alloy, but the ductility is obviously increased. Thus, the high strength achieved in other Mo10HEAs is attributed to the formation of μ phase precipitates. The detailed characterization of μ phases, including morphology and dispersion, is further analyzed by TEM.",['f0010'],[]
3.1,Results.Mechanical properties," Fig. 3 presents TEM bright-field images of recrystallized Mo10HEAs. In contrast to non-uniformly distributed large μ phase in homogenized sample ( Fig. 2 a), nanoscale μ precipitates have average size of 80nm~200nm with respect to annealing condition and are uniformly distributed in the Mo10HEAs. In addition, annealing twins grow in the interior of grains. It can be seen in Fig. 3 a–e that μ particles grow mainly at boundaries (grain boundaries, triple junctions, and annealing twin boundaries), and secondarily in the interior of grains. Fig. 3 g and h show variation of the size and number of μ phase precipitates with annealing condition. With increasing the annealing temperature, the size of μ phase precipitates increases, but their number decreases. A long period of annealing (1h) results in large-sized μ phase precipitates. In addition, the size of μ phase precipitates at boundaries is bigger than that in the interior of grains.","['f0015', 'f0010', 'f0015', 'f0015']",[]
3.1,Results.Mechanical properties,"Chemical composition analysis of μ phase based on EDX measurement indicates a high concentration of Mo atoms in μ phase. Grain boundaries, annealing twin boundaries and high-density dislocation walls provide a rapid diffusion channel for Mo atoms and consequently promote the nucleation and growth of μ particles at these places. In contrast to grain and annealing twin boundaries, dislocations density generally decreases associated with thermodynamic recovery during annealing process, leading to slow growth of μ precipitates at the interior of grains. This accounts for the larger size of μ particles at boundaries than in the interior of grains. Thus nucleation of μ phase precipitates can be rationalized as follows. When the cold-rolled metals are heated to high temperature during annealing, recrystallization takes place. For the metals with the low stacking-fault energy, annealing twins form. The recrystallization velocity of microscale local areas can be significantly different in deformed HEAs matrix due to the inhomogeneous nature of plastic deformation at a fine scale[47,48]. When the local recrystallization proceeds quickly during annealing, μ particles precipitate at recrystallized fine grain boundaries (or edges) and annealing twin boundaries. Otherwise, μ particles precipitate at the interior of deformed grains where high-density of dislocations facilitates diffusion of Mo atoms.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Mechanical properties,"Corresponding to the decreasing density of μ phase precipitates with the increase of annealing temperature, Mo10HEAs exhibit a decreasing strength ( Table 2 ). For instance, the yield strength decreases from 1.31GPa atT=800°C down to 0.8GPa atT=1000°C, so does the UTS (1.41GPa to 1.13GPa). Opposite to the decrease of strengths, the ductility of Mo10HEAs exhibits an increasing trend ( Table 2 ). The EL to fracture increases from 12.1% atT=800°C to 28.2% atT=1000°C. This is ascribed to two factors — grain size and precipitation. Average grain size increases with the increase of annealing temperature, 2.5±0.5μm as annealing at 700–850°C, 4.0±0.5μm as annealing at 900–1000°C, and 6.0±0.5μm as annealing at above 1000°C. Corresponding to the increase of grain size, the yield strength decreases, being consistent with the Hall-Petch relation. However, the ductility generally increases. The other factor is the dimension and distribution of hard and brittle μ phase precipitates. In homogenized Mo10HEAs, μ phase precipitates are large, about 1.8μm, and clustered at grain boundaries. They cannot effectively increase yield strength and ultimate tension strength, because plastic deformation is dominated by dislocations activity in the interior of grains. In addition, these clustered, large μ phase precipitates reduce the compatibility of plastic deformation across grains, leading to the early failure associated with initiation of micro-cracks. After thermal-mechanical processing and annealing, a large amount of discrete, nanometer μ phase precipitates grow in FCC-phase Mo10HEAs. Average size of μ particles is in the range of 80–200nm as annealing at temperature of 800°C−1000°C. These nanoscale μ particles are distributed at boundaries and in the interior of grains, blocking the motion of dislocations and strengthening materials. With increasing the annealing temperature, more precipitates grow at boundaries, correspondingly weakening the strengthening effect associated with dislocation-precipitate interactions. TEM bright-field images in Fig. 4 a and bshow the interaction of dislocations with nanoscale μ precipitates in annealed Mo10HEAs. The precipitates block a large amount of dislocations, as a consequence, forming the pileup of dislocations. Continuing deformation results the bow-out of the pinned segment of dislocations. It is noted that μ precipitates is not plastically sheared by gliding dislocations during plastic deformation. These non-shearable μ precipitates accounts for high strength of Mo10alloy according to precipitation strengthening mechanism and high strain hardening rate at the early stage of plastic deformation ( Fig. 1 c).","['f0020', 'f0005']","['t0010', 't0010']"
3.1,Results.Mechanical properties,"The strain-hardening rate is not sensitive to the size and number of μ phase precipitates. This can be attributed to pronounced solution strengthening effect of the Mo addition in single phase Mo10alloys, as evidenced by the higher strain hardening rate of single-phase Mo10alloy after true strain exceeds 13% (see Fig. 1 c). In addition, nanotwinning also plays an important role in strength, ductility, and strain hardening. As demonstrated in Fig. 4 d, numerous deformation nanotwins are observed in single phase Mo10alloy at a strain of 25%. Selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns taken along the [110] zone axis confirm formation of twins (the extra spots associated with twins are marked by red circle). Twin boundaries resulted from nanotwinning provide a steady source of strain hardening by blocking the motion of dislocations. Thus, single phase Mo10HEAs plastically deform via dislocation gliding and nanotwinning, significantly enhancing strain hardening capability. Combining with solution strengthening effect of the Mo addition, single-phase Mo10alloy achieves high UTS ~918MPa and EL ~62.4%. When the precipitation strengthening mechanism is realized in Mo10HEAs in association with the formation of nanoscale μ phase precipitates, mechanical strengths of Mo10HEAs are further improved, but the ductility slightly decreases. By tailoring thermo-mechanical processing and annealing condition, one can optimize the density and size of μ precipitates in Mo10HEAs, consequently, realizing the combination of strength and ductility.","['f0005', 'f0020']",[]
4,Conclusions,"In summary, we fabricate a series of Cr-Fe-Co-Ni-Mo high-entropy alloys (HEA) with simultaneous adjustment of Mo, Co and Cr contents by arc-melting technique. These HEAs are further recrystallized through thermal-mechanical processing and annealing at different temperatures. We obtain single FCC-phase, non-equiatomic Cr15Fe20Co35Ni20Mo10(Mo10) and Cr12.5Fe20Co42.5Ni20Mo5(Mo5) HEAs. Both exhibit an exceptional strength-ductility combination due to the significant solution strengthening effect of the Mo and nanotwinning. Particularly, Mo10HEAs can be further tuned to comprise nanoscale Mo-rich μ phase precipitates, achieving the combination of three strengthening mechanisms (solution strengthening, nanotwinning, and precipitation strengthening mechanism). After annealing at 800–1000°C, Mo10alloy displays excellent yield strength of 1.03GPa, ultimate tensile strength of 1.25GPa and a good ductility of ~20%. TEM observation of deformed Mo10alloy confirm the nanotwinning and precipitation strengthening mechanism, and the stress-strain curves and strain hardening rates evidence solution strengthening effect of Mo in FCC phase matrix. These findings shed a light on the development of FCC-phase, non-equiatomic HEAs with superior mechanical properties.",[],[]
