0,Abstract,"Refractory high-entropy alloys hold the potential for high-temperature applications beyond the capability of the state-of-the-art Ni-based superalloys, and thus, it is important to study their solid solution formation characteristics and mechanical properties. In this study, designed by CALPHAD method, formation of as-cast arc-melted body-centered cubic MoNbTaTiV was experimentally verified using X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The measured density and lattice parameter for MoNbTaTiV are                         9.29                                                g                        /                        c                                                   m                           3                                              and 3.224 Å, which obey the rule of mixtures (ROM). The alloy exhibits high hardness at 443 Hv, high yield strength at 1.4 GPa, and good compressive fracture strength at 2.45 GPa with a fracture strain of                                                    ∼                           30                           %                                              at room temperature. The yield strength and hardness values of this alloy, and other single-phase refractory high-entropy alloys, are estimated using a simple model of solid solution strengthening. Reasonable agreement between modeling prediction and experiments is obtained. In addition, first-principles density functional theory calculations predict an enthalpy of formation of −0.865 kJ/mol for the MoNbTaTiV alloy, with calculated atomic volume and elastic properties (e.g., bulk and elastic moduli) obeying the ROM.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs)[1,2], which are loosely defined as consisting of five, or more, principal elements, possess high configurational entropy, in principle, and may favor (although not always result in) the formation of single-phase solid solution. Solid solution HEAs have been reported in simple crystal structures, such as face-centered cubic (FCC)[1,3], body-centered cubic (BCC)[4,5], and hexagonal close-packed (HCP)[6–8]lattices. It is claimed that the four core effects[2,9], including high configurational entropy, sluggish diffusion, severe lattice distortion, and cock-tail effect, are mainly responsible for the various physical and mechanical properties[10,11]unique to HEAs. For example, at temperatures down to −196 °C, the CoCrFeMnNi HEA has exceptional tensile strengths of between 730 and 1280 GPa, with fracture toughness values exceeding 200 MPa∙m1/2at crack initiation and rising to >300 MPa∙m1/2during stable crack growth[12]. At 1600 °C, BCC MoNbTaW and MoNbTaVW HEAs maintain yield strengths of 405 and 477 MPa, respectively, which are noticeably higher than Inconel 718 and Haynes 230[13]. The excellent performance of these various HEAs have opened up new areas of materials research for a wide range of applications.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"It is known that several key refractory metals (such as Cr, Mo and W) suffer from low temperature embrittlement[14,15], while many refractory HEAs (such as MoNbTaW[13]and MoNbTaVW[13]) also possess limited ductility at room temperature. To enhance refractory HEA ductility, a series of BCC HEAs have been designed based on around Nb, Ta, and V, yielding compositions such as NbTaTiV[16], NbTaVW[16], NbTaTiVW[16], and MoNbTaV[17]. While NbTaTiV is very ductile and does not fracture at the test strain limit of 50% at room temperature, its yield strength is only 965 MPa. Although NbTaVW, NbTaTiVW, and MoNbTaV have much higher yield strength than NbTaTiV, they exhibit low ductility at room temperature. Consequently, the present study was undertaken to study more completely the microstructure and mechanical properties of MoNbTaTiV, aiming to balance ductility and strength. In this regard, replacing W with Mo in NbTaTiVW also reduces the density of the alloy.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Traditionally, solid solution strengthening (SSS) plays an important role in strengthening a wide range of alloys including HEAs, and contributing to higher yield strength and hardness values in HEAs. Furthermore, following Labush's approach in modeling solid solution strengthening[18], simple models[19–21]that consider the differences in shear modulus and atomic size among the constituent elements in the solid solution have been used to quantitatively predict SSS in HEAs. With recent reports of more single-phase HEAs in the literature, it becomes necessary to re-examine how the proposed SSS models[19,20]for HEAs may be applied to these alloys.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"It is also known that the yield strength is roughly equal to 1/3 of the hardness for conventional metals and alloys, and thus, another objective of this work was to examine the applicability of this empirical relationship between hardness and yield strength as it pertains to single-phase, solid solution strengthened HEAs. In addition, there have only been limited reports that address elastic properties of HEAs[22–26], and this work attempts to determine the elastic properties at zero temperature using first-principle density functional theory (DFT) calculations, in particular as it pertains to the rule of mixtures (ROM).",[],[]
1,Introduction,The MoNbTaTiV HEA was designed using CALPHAD (acronym of Calculation of Phase Diagrams) method. The alloy was then fabricated using the arc-melting technique. The as-cast microstructure was characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Mechanical properties at room temperature were determined using compression testing in conjunction with Vickers hardness measurements.,[],[]
2,Computational methods,"CALPHAD calculations were carried out using TCNI8 thermodynamic database supplied by ThermoCalc™[27]. This database covers the complete constituent binaries of the Mo-Nb-Ta-Ti-V system. Previous calculations using this database have demonstrated good agreement with experimental results for various refractory BCC HEAs[5,16,17,28,29], but it is anticipated that inclusion of thermodynamic descriptions for all ternaries will enhance the reliability of the database especially in applications for HEAs. Recent publications[30–34]detail the database development and applications of CALPHAD modeling for HEAs.",[],[]
2,Computational methods,"The DFT calculations were performed using VASP (Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package)[35,36], a plane-wave pseudo-potential software package. The input atomic structure of disordered MoNbTaTiV with the BCC structure was taken from a 125-atom special quasi-random structures (SQS) model that was reported in Ref.[23]. Projector augmented-wave (PAW) potentials[37]were used as supplied with VASP and the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof[38]gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation functional. Brillouin zone integrations were performed using a 3 × 3 × 3 k-point mesh via the Monkhorst–Pack method[39], and a smearing parameter of 0.2 eV was chosen for the Methfessel–Paxton[40]technique. The plane-wave energy cutoff was held constant at 300 eV. All structures (both lattice parameters and atomic coordinates) were fully relaxed under zero pressure until the energy convergence reached 1 meV/atom. The enthalpy of formation was calculated by subtracting the composition–weighted total energies of the constituent elements from the total energy of the alloy. For simplicity, the zero-point energy is neglected in the present study, which might be important for other calculations.",[],[]
3,Experimental procedures,"The MoNbTaTiV alloy (at. %) was synthesized by vacuum arc melting nominal mixtures of the constituent elements (weight percentage purity ≥ 99.9%) under a Ti-gettered argon atmosphere. The constituent elements were placed in the ingot well in a water-cooled copper hearth crucible with a diameter of∼35mm with a depth of∼15mm. To improve the chemical homogeneity of the constituent elements, the ingot was remelted at least seven times, flipping the ingot between melts. The resultant crystal structure in the as-cast ingot was characterized by X-ray diffractometer using Cu Kα radiation with a scan range for 2θ between 20 and 80°. The alloy density was measured with the Drainage method. The microstructure of the as-cast alloy was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) utilizing energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) to identify phases. Vickers hardness was measured on polished cross-sections using a diamond pyramid under 1 kg load applied for 15 s. Ten random indents were used to give the average Vickers hardness number. The cylindrical specimens for compression tests were electric-discharged machined from the as-cast ingot. Each sample had a diameter of 3 mm with a height of 6 mm. The opposing faces were polished to mirror-like finish as well as to insure they were planar and parallel sided. Three compression samples were tested at room temperature using a strain rate of 5 × 10−4s−1.",[],[]
4.1,Results.CALPHAD calculations,"The calculated equilibrium phase mole fraction versus temperature for the bulk composition (i.e., Mo19.1Nb20.2Ta21Ti21.3V18.3, seeTable 1) is shown inFig. 1(a). The calculated liquidus temperature is Tliq= 2366 °C. The calculated solidus temperature is Tsol= 2162 °C. Disordered BCC solid solution is the primary crystallization phase, and it will start to decompose at Tdec= 516 °C by precipitation of a minor HCP phase that is nearly pure Ti. The ratio of the temperature range where the BCC solid solution is stable over the solidus temperature (i.e.,(Tsol−Tdec)/Tsol) is determined to be 0.68. Gao[41]argued that a ratio greater than 0.30 typically favors a single-phase solid solution in the as-cast state. At 457 °C, another minor phase, enriched in V and also with the BCC structure, will precipitate. However, these predicted precipitates may not form in the usual laboratory setting due to frozen kinetics at temperatures below 457 °C.",['fig1'],['tbl1']
4.1,Results.CALPHAD calculations,"The non-equilibrium solidification simulation was accomplished using the Scheil-Gulliver models[42,43], which assumes equilibrium mixing in the liquid state and no diffusion in the solid state. The simulation predicts formation of a single BCC solid solution during the entire non-equilibrium solidification (seeFig. 1(b)). The real solidification path will be somewhat between equilibrium and Scheil-Gulliver models. The simulation also predicts likely segregation due to constitutional cooling. As the temperature decreases, the liquid is gradually depleted first in Mo followed by Ta, while it is steadily enriched in Ti and V (seeFig. 1(c)). In contrast, the BCC phase is predicted to be rich in Ta and Mo at earlier stages of solidification in the dendrite arms, while the interdendritic region is enriched in Ti and V at later stages (Fig. 1(d)).","['fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1']",[]
4.2,"Results.Density, crystal structure, and microstructure","The measured density of MoNbTaTiV was9.29±0.02g/cm3. Using the densities of the pure elements in the HEA and the bulk composition of the alloy (seeTable 1), the density of a disordered solid solution can also be estimated by the ROM[44]:(1)ρmix=∑inciAi/∑i=1n(ciAi/ρi)whereci,Ai[45], andρi[45]are the atomic concentration, atomic weight, and density of theithelement, respectively; n is the total number of elements in the solid solution. The estimated density(ρmix)for MoNbTaTiV using Eq.(1)is 9.27g/cm3, which is very close to the measured value. The XRD pattern of the as-cast alloy is presented inFig. 2(a). The XRD peaks are indexed as a single BCC phase; the lattice parameter is equal to 3.224 Å.Table 1lists the lattice parameters of all constituent elements[45], and the lattice parameter for the alloy(amix)is estimated to be 3.218 Å using ROM. It is noteworthy that the estimated lattice parameter is fairly close to the experimental value. Both the density and the lattice parameter of the alloy obey the ROM, and this is characteristic of a disordered solid solution.","['fd1', 'fig2']","['tbl1', 'tbl1']"
4.2,"Results.Density, crystal structure, and microstructure","The backscattered-electron (BSE) SEM image of the as-cast alloy (seeFig. 2(b)) shows a typical dendritic microstructure, indicating constitutional segregation during the non-equilibrium solidification. Using the EDS mapping on a small region (Fig. 3), the elemental distribution can be visualized: Ta and Mo enrichments were observed in the dendrite arms, while V and Ti enrichments were seen in the interdendritic regions. In contrast, no obvious Nb segregation was observed.","['fig2', 'fig3']",[]
4.2,"Results.Density, crystal structure, and microstructure","The bulk composition(Caver)of the alloy was estimated using EDS on large areas.Table 1listsCaver, the average composition of the dendrite arms(Cdr), and the average composition of the interdendritic regions(Cidr). As expected, the EDS point-analysis results are consistent with the qualitative elemental mapping analysis shown inFig. 3.",['fig3'],['tbl1']
4.2,"Results.Density, crystal structure, and microstructure","The level of elemental segregation can be described by a linear relationship:(2)ΔC=kΔTwherekis a constant,ΔTi=(Tm)i−Tmmix, andΔC=Cdr−Cidr. Here,(Tm)iis the melting temperature of theithelement[45], andTmmixis the calculated average melting temperature of the alloy using the ROM (seeTable 1).ΔCreveals the excess concentration inside the dendrite arms. TheΔC−ΔTrelation is illustrated inFig. 4. Prior CALPHAD calculations of the Mo-Nb-Ta-V alloy system show that the micro-segregation behavior may be correlated to the compositional dependence of the liquidus and solidus temperatures, and suggest that alloying with elements that tend to increase the liquidus and solidus temperatures of the solid solution alloy are also expected to solidify first before the elements that tend to decrease those temperatures during non-equilibrium solidification[17].",['fig4'],['tbl1']
4.3,Results.Compressive properties and hardness,"Fig. 5shows the engineering stress-strain(σ−ε)compression curves at room temperature (25 °C) for as-cast MoNbTaTiV and the prior four alloys[16,17]. The yield strength(σ0.2exp)of the MoNbTaTiV alloy is 1.4 GPa, while the maximum compressive fracture strength(σf)is 2.45 GPa. The alloy exhibits about 30% compressive strain before fracture, and it exhibits a large work-hardening capacity. Clearly, MoNbTaTiV has significantly improved compression ductility compared to MoNbTaV, NbTaVW, and NbTaTiVW, with slightly reduced yield strength, but tension tests should be performed in future work in order to rigorously measure the ductility of these alloys.",['fig5'],[]
5.1,Discussion.Solid solution strengthening of MoNbTaTiV,"For a general metallic solid solution, the source of SSS can be regarded from the elastic interactions between the local stress field of solute atoms and those of dislocations[18,46]. The interaction force (F) can be calculated as:(3)F=Gb2fwhereGis the shear modulus of the alloy,bis the magnitude of the Burgers vector, andfis the mismatch parameter.

Combining Eqs.(3) and (4), the value for SSS caused by theithelement can be estimated from:","['fd3', 'fd4']",[]
5.1,Discussion.Solid solution strengthening of MoNbTaTiV,"(5)Δσi=AGfi4/3ci2/3whereAis a material-dependent dimensionless constant of the order of 0.04[19]and thefiparameter can be determined by:(6)fi=δGi2+α2δri22whereδGi=(1G)dGdciis the atomic modulus andδri=(1r)drdciis the atomic size mismatch. The value for α is a constant which depends on the type of the mobile dislocation. In general, α is 2–4 for screw dislocations. On the other hand, α ≥ 16 for edge dislocations[19]. The type of dislocations in most alloys is a random mixture of edge and screw dislocations, therefore, the value of α was designated to be 9. For the single-phase HEAs with BCC structure, theδGiandδri(per atom pair) in the vicinity ofithelement can be estimated as the average difference of atomic modulus(δGij)and atomic size(δrij)with its neighbors[19], respectively:(7)δGi=98∑cjδGij(8)δri=98∑cjδrijwherecjis the atomic fraction ofjthelement in the alloy,δGij=2(Gi−Gj)/(Gi+Gj), andδrij=2(ri−rj)/(ri+rj).

5.1,Discussion.Solid solution strengthening of MoNbTaTiV,"It is generally accepted that the hardness of metals and alloys is nearly triple their yield strength[20], so the hardness can be estimated using:(11)HVcal≈3σ0.2cal(MPa)",[],[]
5.1,Discussion.Solid solution strengthening of MoNbTaTiV,"The atomic radii, shear moduli[45], and the yield strength[47]of pure elements are given inTable 1. The shear modulus of the alloy is estimated to be 65.6 GPa using the ROM. The calculated yield strength(σ0.2cal)using Eq.(10)is equal to 1467 MPa, while the calculated hardness (HVcal) is 449 Hv using Eq.(11). The model-predicted values agree well with experimental results for the MoNbTaTiV alloy.","['fd10', 'fd11']",['tbl1']
5.2,Discussion.Mechanical properties of single-phase refractory HEAs,"The experimental validation of the aforementioned semi-empirical models (Eqs.(10) and (11)) is subject to a number of uncertain factors. For example, the available data from the literature manifest considerable scatter for many reasons, including processing parameters, annealing treatment, strain rates, and sample sizes for compressive/tensile testing. Moreover, there are many other strengthening mechanisms, including grain boundary strengthening, strain strengthening, and precipitate strengthening[20]. The hardness of reported HEAs in the literature also vary widely between 140 and 900 Hv, depending on the alloy systems and related processing methods[48].","['fd10', 'fd11']",[]
5.2,Discussion.Mechanical properties of single-phase refractory HEAs,"The simple SSS model detailed in section5.1is first applied to those reported single-phase refractory HEAs[16,17,19,28,29,49–51], as listed inTable 2. The emphasis is to compare yield strength and hardness values as determined from model simulation and experimental measurement. Each of these alloys was fabricated via the vacuum arc melting method. XRD demonstrated that they were single-phase BCC solid solutions. These as-cast alloys exhibited the typical dendritic microstructure expected in castings of this nature. The grain sizes for the majority of alloys were 100–200 μm in extent with secondary dendrite arm spacing in the range of 10–30 μm (seeTable 2). Note that for MoNbTaW and MoNbTaVW alloys, the calculated yield strength and hardness values were much higher than the experimental ones, and this could be due to presence of micro-porosity that formed during solidification in these samples which reduced the strength of the alloys[4].",[],"['tbl2', 'tbl2']"
5.2,Discussion.Mechanical properties of single-phase refractory HEAs,"Fig. 6(a) comparesσ0.2expwithHVexp. For most of the alloys, theHVexpvalues are 3–3.3 times theσ0.2expexcept for the HfNbTaTiZr alloy that has aHVexp/σ0.2expratio of 4.1. Homogenization treatment diminishes internal stress generated from the high cooling rate during solidification while coarsening the microstructure[51], and thus, may impact the mechanical properties. Guo et al.[51]reported that bothσ0.2expandHVexpvalues of HfMoNbTiZr decrease slightly after homogenization. However, the calculatedσ0.2calandHVcalvalues agree better with experimental values in the as-cast state than the as-annealed state, which is counterintuitive. For example, theσ0.2calis a little larger than theσ0.2expfor as-annealed NbTiVZr alloy. Comparisons inσ0.2calvs.σ0.2expandHVcalvs.HVexpare illustrated inFig. 6(b) and (c), respectively, and the agreement is largely acceptable although the scatter in hardness is less than the scatter in the yield strength.","['fig6', 'fig6']",[]
5.2,Discussion.Mechanical properties of single-phase refractory HEAs,"Next the simple SSS model is applied to the HfMoxNbTaTiZr HEAs to predict the compositional dependency of the mechanical properties. Juan et al.[52]reported that the as-cast HfMoxNbTaTiZr HEAs(x≤1)have a simple BCC phase with typical dendritic structure. Also, the yield strength and hardness values of the alloys increase with increasing Mo contents. The model predictions correctly capture the compositional dependence of yield strength and hardness values (Fig. 7(a)), and the agreement in hardness is exceptionally good for HfNbTaTiZr, Mo0.25HfNbTaTiZr, and Mo0.75HfNbTaTiZr. On the other hand, theσ0.2calis higher thanσ0.2expfor these alloys, however, the largest deviation is less than 15%. This is understandable since the SSS model does not take into account inhomogeneity in microstructure, chemical short-range order, or elemental segregation, all of which may vary with increasing Mo molar ratio in the as-cast HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys.",['fig7'],[]
5.2,Discussion.Mechanical properties of single-phase refractory HEAs,"The dominant parameters in the SSS model areδriandδGi, which address the differences in atomic radius and shear modulus among constituent elements in a solid solution, respectively. The Mo content dependence ofδriandδGiare shown inFig. 7(b) and (c), respectively. The model predicts that|δri|pertaining to elements Mo and Zr outweigh significantly those pertaining to Hf, Ta, Ti, and Nb, for all compositions (Fig. 7(b)). Moreover, with increasing Mo contents,|δri|pertaining to elements Zr and Hf increase, while they decrease for the other elements. Regarding|δGi|, the model also predicts that contributions pertaining to elements Mo and Zr are several times those pertaining to elements Hf, Ta, Ti, and Nb (Fig. 7(c)). Moreover, with increasing Mo contents,|δGi|pertaining to elements Zr and Ti increase, while they decrease for the other elements. Combining the contributions from both|δri|and|δGi|, the contribution pertaining to Zr dominates the SSS of HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys with x ≤ 0.75, followed by Mo for the compositions with x ≥ 0.25 (Fig. 7(d)). For equimolar HfMoNbTaTiZr alloy, the overall contributions from Zr and Mo are nearly equal. In fact, replacing Ta by Mo in HfNbTaTiZr can boost the yield strength from 919 MPa for HfNbTaTiZr[19]to 1719 MPa for HfMoNbTiZr[51].","['fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7']",[]
5.3,Discussion.First-principles DFT calculations,"The DFT calculations predict an enthalpy of formation of −0.865 kJ/mol for the MoNbTaTiV alloy at zero temperature, which is in somewhat contrast with the enthalpy of formation for other BCC refractory HEAs: −7.313, −4.272, +8.353 kJ/mol for MoNbTaW, MoNbTaVW, and HfNbTaTiZr, respectively[23]. Binary phase diagrams[53]reveal miscibility gap at lower temperatures between refractory BCC metals and HCP metals, therefore, it is not surprising to see that the enthalpy of formation becomes more positive with increasing the contents of HCP metals in refractory BCC HEAs. The elastic property of the MoNbTaTiV alloy and its constituent elements are calculated using the basic elastic stress-strain relationship:(12)σi=∑j=16Cijεjwhereσi,εjandCij, are the elastic stress, strain, and tensor in the Voigt notation, respectively.Cijcan be derived from this relation by performing six finite distortions of the lattice as implemented in VASP[15,54]. In order to compensate an anisotropic effect (if any) due to low symmetry of SQS lattices and size effect of the SQS model, single–crystal C11, C12and C44for cubic structures are obtained[15,23]:(13)C11=C11+C22+C333|SQSC12=C12+C23+C133|SQSC44=C44+C55+C663|SQS",[],[]

Polycrystalline elastic properties are derived using the Voigt–Reuss–Hill approach averaging method[56]. The calculated isotropic polycrystalline elastic properties are: B = 181.20, G = 50.71, E = 139.15, and ν = 0.372. The elastic properties of the alloy and the pure elements are listed inTable 3, and they are in good agreement with experimental values reported for pure elements except Vanadium.

5.3,Discussion.First-principles DFT calculations,"The bulk moduli of the alloy and the constituent elements are calculated using the pressure-volume equation of states (EOS), which can also be used to calculate the optimal lattice parameter. A set of 7 different volumes were isotropically expanded, or contracted, from the fully relaxed structure and then their atomic positions and lattice shape were allowed to relax at the fixed volume. The resulting total energy versus the volume for the alloy and the pure elements are illustrated inFig. 8(b). The data set were then used to fit the third-order Birch-Murnaghan pressure-volume EOS[57]:(14)P=3B02[(V0V)7/3−(V0V)5/3]{1+34(B1−4)[(V0V)2/3−1]}wherePis the pressure,V0is the equilibrium volume,Vis the deformed volume,B0is the bulk modulus, andB1is the derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure.

The average values estimated using the ROM are indicated by the horizontal lines in the plots. The DFT-calculated atomic volume for the alloy matches the average value extremely well, and this is consistent with the observation that the measured lattice parameter and density obey the ROM. The agreement in bulk modulus and shear modulus between DFT calculations and ROM averages are largely acceptable within the uncertainty of DFT computation. Therefore, these results seem to suggest that the atomic volume and elastic properties (bulk and shear moduli) of MoNbTaTiV obey the ROM, but this prediction is yet to be confirmed by future experimental work.",['fig8'],[]

The details on the calculation ofSEcan be found in Ref.[64]. Ye et al.[64]found a criticalϕcvalue of 20, and they claimed that a HEA tends to display a multi-phased structure whenϕ<ϕcwhile a single-phase solid solution whenϕ>ϕc[64].",['fd16'],[]
5.4,Discussion.Empirical rules for solid solution formation,"The calculated empirical parameters for the MoNbTaTiV alloy are:ΔHmix=−2.47kJ/mol, δ = 3.36%, Ω = 14.1, VEC = 5,Δχ=0.028, andϕ= 31.32 (seeTables 1 and 4). These values favor formation of single-phase solid solution with BCC structure, and this agrees with the CALPHAD prediction, and the experimental observations.",[],"['tbl1', 'tbl4']"
5.4,Discussion.Empirical rules for solid solution formation,"Although lowΔχand largeΩvalues tend to promote solid solution phase formation, they and other empirical parameters are not sufficient requirements[5]. Furthermore, those threshold values proposed for aforementioned empirical parameters may be a range of values rather than a fixed value, and are susceptible to the experimental data available in the assessment. For example, a recent report by Feng et al.[65]identified the criteria for light-weight HEAs:ϕc≥7,δr≤4.7%, andΔHmix≥−16.25kJ·mol−1. On the other hand, an effective approach in searching for single-phase HEA compositions can use a combination of phase diagram inspection, CALPHAD modeling, first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations, andab initiomolecular dynamics simulations[7,10,31,41]. In fact, using this strategy, Gao[41]predicted hundreds of quaternary and higher-order equimolar compositions in the Dy-Er-Gd-Ho-Lu-Sc-Sm-Tb-Tm-Y, Ba-Ca-Eu-Sr-Yb, and Mo-Nb-Re-Ta-Ti-V-W systems.",[],[]
6,Conclusions,"In summary, this study confirmed a single BCC phase in as-cast MoNbTaTiV HEA fabricated via arc-melting, as predicted by CALPHAD modeling using the TCNI8 database. The microstructure was examined using XRD and SEM. Mechanical properties were characterized through compression testing and Vickers hardness tests. The elastic properties of the MoNbTaTiV alloy and its constituent elements were studied using DFT method. The following conclusions can be reached:1)The measured density and lattice parameter for MoNbTaTiV are9.29g/cm3and 3.224 Å, which obey the ROM.2)The DFT calculated lattice parameter for MoNbTaTiV is 3.2130 Å, and the enthalpy of formation is −0.865 kJ/mol. The calculated elastic properties derived from stress-strain relation are:C11=263.9GPa,C12=139.9GPa,C44=44.3GPa, B = 181.20 GPa, G = 50.71 GPa, E = 139.15 GPa, and ν = 0.372. The bulk modulus calculated from EOS is 174.47 GPa. The calculated atomic volume and elastic properties (e.g., bulk and shear moduli) for the alloy obey the ROM within the computation uncertainties.3)Microsegregation was observed in the casting through segregation in the dendritic microstructure: For as-cast MoNbTaTiV, Mo and Ta are enriched in the dendrite arms, while Ti and V are enriched in the interdendritic regions. The observed microsegregation behavior is consistent with non-equilibrium solidification modeling using CALPHAD.4)The calculated empirical parameters for MoNbTaTiV favors formation of a single-phase solid solution with the BCC structure:ΔHmix=−2.47kJ/mol, δ = 3.36%, Ω = 14.1, VEC = 5,Δχ=0.028, andϕ= 31.32.5)The alloy exhibits substantial solid solution strengthening, large work hardening capability, and a compression fracture strain of 30% at room temperature. The measured yield strength, fracture strength, and hardness are 1.4 GPa, 2.45 GPa, and 443 Hv, respectively.6)The simple SSS model predicts well the yield strength of MoNbTaTiV and other reported single-phase refractory HEAs; the hardness values are approximately three times the yield strength.7)For HfMoxNbTaTiZr (x ≤ 1) alloys, the SSS model predicts that Zr and Mo dominate the contributions to the SSS in HfMoxNbTaTiZr.",[],[]
