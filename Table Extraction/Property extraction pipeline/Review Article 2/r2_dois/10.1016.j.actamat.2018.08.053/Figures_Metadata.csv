fig1,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.08.053/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,CALPHAD-calculation data for NbTaTiV. Calculated equilibrium phase mole fractions during solidification for Nb23.8Ta25.5Ti24.9V25.8. The inset shows the composition evolution of the BCC solid-solution phase during non-equilibrium solidification using the Scheil–Gulliver models.
fig2,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.08.053/figures/gr2a.jpg,Fig. 2,"Phase and microstructural characteristics of as-cast NbTaTiV, studied by SEM, ND, EBSD, and APT data. (a) The dendritic microstructure in SEM-BSE images of the as-cast NbTaTiV alloy (b) Neutron-diffraction patterns with the peaks indexed for a BCC structure (c) EBSD-phase map of the as-cast NbTaTiV alloy (d) Concentration-depth profile of all alloying elements taken along the black arrow (top), three-dimensional atom maps of individual elements (middle) and frequent-distribution histograms (bottom), for the dendritic region, and (e) Interdendritic region in the as-cast NbTaTiV alloy. The frequency-distribution histograms of constituent elements were calculated with a block size of 100 atoms with the solid lines showing the binomial-distribution curves, and the dots are the observed experimental results."

The SEM-BSE images of after-annealed samples at different temperatures and time periods: (a) 1000 °C for 1 day, (b) 1200 °C for 1 day, and (c) 1200 °C for 3 days, (d) Neutron-diffraction patterns of the NbTaTiV alloy after the heat treatment at 1200 °C for 3 days with the peaks indexed for a BCC structure. (e) EBSD-phase map of the homogenization-treated NbTaTiV alloy, and (f) A one-dimensional concentration-depth profile of all alloying elements taken along the black arrow for the homogenization-treated NbTaTiV alloy (top). Three-dimensional atom maps of individual elements (bottom) (g) FDA of constituent elements with a block size of 100 atoms for the homogenized NbTaTiV alloy. The solid lines are the binomial distribution, while dots are the observed experimental results."

(a) Engineering compressive stress-strain curves of the as-cast and homogenization-treated NbTaTiV at room temperature. Evolution of lattice strains for (b) [110] (c) [200] oriented planes in as-cast (black line) and homogenization-treated (red line) alloys as a function of applied stress. Evolution of normalized peak widths as a function of macro-strain for (d) As-cast, and (e) Homogenization-treated NbTaTiV HEAs.

fig5,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.08.053/figures/gr5.jpg,Fig. 5,"SEM and EBSD images of the deformed lateral surface. (a) SEM micrograph of the homogenization-treated alloy after 15% deformation. (b and c) The EBSD phase and inverse pole-figure mapping images of the 15 %-deformed homogenized NbTaTiV at room temperature. The SEM micrograph of the 15 %-deformed homogenized sample shows a large density of slip bands that were nonuniformly oriented within different grains formed during plastic deformation. Furthermore, no strain-induced phase transformation was found to occur during compression testing, i.e., the single BCC solid-solution phase is observed on the phase map, and other deformation bands, such as local twin bands, were not observed from EBSD analyses."

Compressive engineering stress-strain curves and a summary of compression-yield strength (σy) for the homogenization-treated NbTaTiV alloy obtained at room temperature, 300 °C, 500 °C, 700 °C, 800 °C, and 900 °C, respectively."

(a) Distribution of the interatomic distances for the first to fifth nearest neighbors (NN) of the BCC NbTaTiV HEA calculated from the optimized SQS. The blue dashed lines show the average interatomic distances for the first to fifth NNs, and (b) Box plot presenting the distribution of interatomic distances of 1NN bonds in the SQS for the BCC NbTaTiV HEA. The box presents the first and third quartiles of the bond lengths for a type of atomic bonds. The whisker extends to either the 1.5 interquartile ranges or the maximum and minimum values. The median and mean for each type of atomic bonds exhibit as the green solid line and red dashed line, respectively. The reference bond lengths, calculated from comparable BCC structures for the homoatomic pairs and B2 structures for the heteroatomic pairs, are shown in blue squares. (c) Two different locally-relaxed atomic structures of the BCC NbTaTiV HEA. The shortest and longest bond lengths of the NbNb and V-V pairs for the first nearest neighbors in the supercells with the SQS model.
