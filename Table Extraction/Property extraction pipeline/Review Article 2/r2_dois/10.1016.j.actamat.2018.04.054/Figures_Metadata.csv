fig1,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.04.054/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,"The mechanical responses of single crystals oriented along <001>C<111>T, <122>Tand <144>Ttogether with select DIC strain contours. Error bars for the <144>Tcase demonstrate the reproducibility of the softening behavior."
fig2,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.04.054/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,EBSD orientation maps of single crystals oriented strained in tension to ∼11% along (a) <122>Tand (b) <144>T.
fig3,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.04.054/figures/gr3.jpg,Fig. 3,"Full-field (3 mm × 10 mm) strain contours at different axial strain intervals. The images illustrate the spatial strain distribution for (a) the <144>Tcase from 0 to 3% strain, (b) the <144>Tcase from 8 to 10% strain and (c) the <111>Tcase from 8 to 10% strain."
fig4,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.04.054/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,Evolution of loading direction for each crystal orientation from 0% to ∼10% axial strain.
fig5,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.04.054/figures/gr5.jpg,Fig. 5,"Examples for twin-related interactions in FeMnNiCoCr observed by TEM illustrating (a) twin-slip, (b) twin-twin and (c,d) slip-twin mechanisms. Arrows in the close-up view in (c) indicate the assumed direction of lattice dislocation motion. (d) Several interlocked stacking faults are marked and the dark-field image shows the resulting chevron fringe pattern in detail. The traces of primary and secondary twin/slip system are indicated in the inset."
fig6,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.04.054/figures/gr6.jpg,Fig. 6,"The normalized flow stress as a function of residual dislocation magnitude for each crystal orientation, where slip-twin interactions are observed for <144>Tand <122>Tcases and twin-twin interactions for <111>Tand <001>Ccases. The dashed lines are guides for the eye."
fig7,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.04.054/figures/gr7.jpg,Fig. 7,(A) Increase of total dislocation density and (b) ratio of density on primary to secondary slip system depending on axial strain in FeMnNiCoCr at 77 K. The TEM image in (b) shows an example for slip-slip interaction. SC stands for single crystal. Dashes indicate the linear approximations used to model the dislocation density in Section4.3.
fig8,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.04.054/figures/gr8.jpg,Fig. 8,"LHR for different deformation mechanisms: (a) twin-twin interaction observed in <111>Tcase, (b) twin-slip interaction observed in <144>Tcase and (c) slip-twin interaction observed in <144>Tcase. * Note that the axial strain presented for the twin-twin case in <111>Tis offset by ∼9% of strain which is mainly accommodated by the primary twin system prior to activation of the second twin system. Dashes show the overall trends."
