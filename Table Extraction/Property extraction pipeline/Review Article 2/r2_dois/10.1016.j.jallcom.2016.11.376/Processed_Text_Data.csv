The phase stability analyses were performed using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Mechanical properties were characterized using hardness and tensile tests. All the investigated alloys exhibit a single face-centered cubic (FCC) phase in the as-cast state. Cr-rich sigma phase precipitated in the Co5 and Co10 alloys after being annealed for 48 h, while the Co20 alloy remains a single FCC phase. With precipitation of the hard yet brittle sigma phase, the hardness and yield strength of Co5 and Co10 alloys increase while the tensile elongation decreases. Compared with the Co5 alloy, the variation of hardness, yield strength and tensile elongation is smaller for the Co10 alloy due to a smaller volume fraction of sigma phase. The hardness and yield strength of Co20 alloy show a subtle decrease, however the tensile elongation remains almost unchanged. The present result could help to understand the phase stability and mechanical properties of this typical Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Mn HEA system from compositional perspective.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High entropy alloys (HEAs) are multi-component (5 or more) alloys with equiatomic or near-equiatomic composition[1,2]. The research on the HEAs is gaining increasing momentum since their advent[3–5]due to their excellent properties[6–10]and potential applications[11]. Furthermore, HEAs could also serve as model systems to investigate scientific problems, such as the phase formation[12–14]and phase stability[15,16]of multi-component alloys. As to the phase formation, simple solid solution phases usually the face-centered cubic (FCC) or body-centered cubic (BCC) instead of many intermetallic compounds form for the alloys with multiple principal elements in equimolar or near-equimolar ratios, and the mixing entropy was considered to play a key role[17]. With deeper investigation, it is found that intermetallics or amorphous phase form[18,19]in many cases for the multicomponent alloys. Concerning the phase stability, sluggish diffusion kinetics have been proposed to explain the structural stability[1]and were verified experimentally[20]. However, recent results indicated that the sluggish diffusion in HEAs is not a guarantee of stable structure and precipitate would form after annealing[21–23]. Since the precipitate would lead to changes in mechanical properties, the phase stability of HEAs is an important consideration for the high temperature applications[24].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Among the known HEA systems, a subset with elements of Co, Cr, Fe, Ni and Mn forming a single solid solution phase draws attention[1,25–28]. Equiatomic CoCrFeNiMn with a single FCC phase was regarded as a prototypical HEA and investigated extensively, including mechanical properties[29], phase formation[30]and phase stability[30–37]. It was once thought that the CoCrFeNiMn HEA shows high thermal stability against homogenization and annealing[30–33]and exhibits simple FCC structure in the whole temperature range of solid state[38]. However, several recent studies indicated that even this alloy is not stable and undergoes phase transformation during annealing[35–37]. Schuh et al.[35]found that precipitate forms when the severely plastically deformed alloy was annealed. Pickering et al.[36]and Otto et al.[37]found that new phases precipitate in this HEA even in the unworked state during prolonged anneals and as a result the single FCC phase can no longer be regarded as the thermodynamically stable phase. The microstructure and properties of materials are sensitive to the composition[39,40]and the composition also plays a key role in influencing the phase formation and stability of HEAs[41,42]. For instance, Al is usually the “BCC stabilizer” for the AlxCoCrFeNi HEAs[41]and Co and Ni are usually “FCC stabilizers” for the Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Cu-Al HEA alloy system[42]. However, little work has been conducted to investigate the elemental effect on the phase stability of HEAs up to now, even for the well-known Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Mn alloy system. Besides, though the precipitation of Cr-rich sigma phase has been identified for the CoCrFeNiMn HEA[36,37], it is still unclear how the precipitate affects the mechanical properties of HEAs.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In the present research, we report the annealing effect on the phase stability of (FeNiCrMn)(100−x)Cox(x= 5, 10 and 20, denoted as Coxhereafter) HEAs during short-term annealing at 850 °C. Since the mechanical properties of HEAs are structural sensitive[43,44], the annealing effect on the mechanical properties of the HEAs was also investigated. The results could help to understand the phase stability of this typical Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Mn HEA system from elemental perspective and help to tune the microstructure and mechanical properties.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"The alloy ingots of nominal compositions (FeNiCrMn)(100−x)Cox(x= 5, 10 and 20) were prepared by arc melting mixtures of raw materials in a Ti-gettered high purity argon atmosphere. Each ingot was flipped and remelted at least four times to ensure chemical homogeneity. The molten alloy was cast into copper mould with dimension of 30 × 10 × 2 mm3. The samples were annealed at 850 °C for 12, 24 and 48 h, and then quenched in water. The structures of the samples were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Rigaku SmartLab) using Cu Kαradiation with scanning speed of 2° or 0.75° min−1. The microstructure was examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM; JSM-820) equipped with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Philips CM-20). TEM samples were prepared by mechanical grinding to∼20 μm thickness followed by ion milling at room temperature.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"Flat dog-bone-shaped tensile specimens with a gauge length of 4 mm were machined from the as-cast plate samples by electric discharge machine. The tensile specimens were ground on each side to remove scratches, resulting in a final specimen with a thickness of 1 mm and a gauge section width of 2 mm. Tensile tests were carried out in a screw-driven Instron 5567 tensile testing machine at an engineering strain rate of 10−3s−1. Hardness measurements were conducted using a Vickers hardness tester with a load of 500 g, and at least 15 measurements were made to obtain an average value for each sample.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Phase identification and microstructure evolution,"Fig. 1(a)–(c) show the XRD patterns of the Co5, Co10and Co20(2°/min) and the detailed scan with lower scanning speed (0.75°/min) are shown inFig. 1(d)–(f), respectively. FromFig. 1(a) and (d), it can be seen that the as-cast Co5exhibits a single FCC crystal structure. However another set of peaks appeared after annealing, which correspond to the precipitates, and the volume fraction of precipitates increased with prolonged annealing time. The structure of the precipitate was indexed to be a Cr-rich sigma phase, which exhibited a tetragonal structure. The XRD patterns for the Co10(Fig. 1(b) and (e)) and Co20(Fig. 1(c) and (f)) alloys showed that the alloys exhibited a single FCC phase both in the as-cast and as-annealed states. However, XRD analysis has a detection limit of approximately 1% of the minor phase[45], which was shown to be present by SEM analysis discussed in the following.","['fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Phase identification and microstructure evolution,An SEM image of the as-cast Co5alloy is shown inFig. 2(a). The alloy comprised a single solid solution phase and no second phase particle was observed. The EDX maps (Fig. 2(b–f)) of the area inFig. 2(a) show that the as-cast alloy had typical dendritic microstructure. Dendrites formed first during solidification and were enriched in Fe and Cr. Mn and Ni were rejected to the liquid and were rich in the interdendritic regions formed at later stages. The distribution of Co is relatively uniform in the dendritic and interdendritic regions.,"['fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Phase identification and microstructure evolution,"Fig. 3(a) shows a representative microstructure of Co5alloy after annealing at 850 °C for 48 h andFig. 3(b–f) show the corresponding EDX maps obtained from the area inFig. 3(a). The microstructure was no longer a single phase, as seen from the backscattered electron image inFig. 3(a), and precipitates with two different contrasts (Label A and B in the figure) could be observed. From the EDX maps, it could be known that both of the precipitates are rich in Cr and EDX results showed that the compositions of the two different precipitates are very similar and rich in Cr (Table 1). This indicates that the precipitates with two different contrasts may be of the same phase and the different channeling contrast may arise from their crystallographic orientation[46].","['fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3']",['tbl1']
3.1,Results and discussion.Phase identification and microstructure evolution,"In order to confirm the presence of precipitates, the annealed Co5sample was examined with TEM, as shown inFig. 4. Selected-area electron diffraction patterns (SADPs) revealed that the precipitates had tetragonal crystal structure, which was consistent with the sigma phase, and that of the matrix phase was FCC. The composition of the precipitate (at. %) was analyzed by the EDX in the TEM and was found to be Cr-rich: Cr = 46.8 ± 0.5, Fe = 21.3 ± 1.2, Mn = 16.9 ± 0.9, Co = 4.9 ± 0.3, and Ni = 9.9 ± 0.9, which is consistent with the EDX result measured by SEM.",['fig4'],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Phase identification and microstructure evolution,"The as-cast Co10alloy also exhibited a single FCC phase and dendritic microstructure (the SEM image and EDX maps are not shown here), which is similar to those of the as cast Co5alloy.Fig. 5(a) shows the SEM image of the Co10annealed at 850 °C for 48 h andFig. 5(b–f) show the corresponding EDX maps obtained from the area inFig. 5(a). It could be seen that a second phase precipitated on the grain boundaries and its composition (at. %) is: Cr = 44.2 ± 1.1, Mn = 15.8 ± 0.6, Fe = 21.5 ± 0.2, Co = 9.0 ± 0.1, Ni = 9.5 ± 0.6. Since its composition is quite similar to the precipitate of the Co5alloy, these Cr-rich precipitates were also thought to be sigma phase as well. The sigma phase in the annealed Co10alloy could not be detected from XRD probably due to its smaller volume fraction[45].","['fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Phase identification and microstructure evolution,"Similar to Co5and Co10alloys, the as-cast Co20exhibited a single FCC solid solution phase and dendritic microstructure (the SEM image and EDX maps are not shown here). However, it still remained a single phase and no intermetallic phase was found after annealing at 850 °C for 48 h (Fig. 6(a)), which is different from the Co5and Co10alloys. These results are consistent with recent finding by other researchers[31–33]. The result indicates that the Co plays a role in stabilizing the phase structure of Coxalloys. The distribution of elements became more homogeneous after annealing, which can be seen from the EDX maps (Fig. 6(b–f)).","['fig6', 'fig6']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Phase identification and microstructure evolution,"Since precipitation of hard and brittle sigma phase has significant influence on the mechanical properties of HEAs[47], usually deteriorating the ductility[48]. Several parameters have been proposed to predict the sigma phase formation and stability[49,50]. In Ref.[49], the critical valence electron concentration (VEC) was proposed and the sigma phase forms when VEC is between 6.88 and 7.84. For the presently investigated Co5, Co10and Co20alloys, the VEC are 7.75, 7.81 and 8.00, respectively[51]. The sigma phase formation for Co5and Co10alloys is in the proposed sigma phase formation region. From the paired sigma-forming element (PSFE) perspective[50], the threshold PSFE content for sigma phase formation is above a value between 40% and 45%. For the Co5HEA, the PSFE is 47.5%, which is in the sigma phase formation region. The PSFE for the Co10and Co20alloys are 45.0% and 47.5%, respectively, which are in the region where the sigma phase may or may not form. For the Co10HEA, the sigma phase precipitates while the Co20alloy remains a single FCC phase. Besides the VEC and PSFE criteria, the stability of topologically close-packed phase (TCP), including the sigma phase, was also delineated from the electron-negativity difference (ΔΧ)[52]. The TCP phase is stable at ΔΧ> 0.133. The ΔΧfor the Co5, Co10and Co20alloys are 0.141, 0.140 and 0.131, respectively, which supports the TCP formation criterion as well. As a result, the present result obeys the VEC, PSFE and ΔΧcriteria[49,50,52].",[],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Hardness and tensile properties,"The hardness evolutions of Co5, Co10and Co20alloys with annealing were shown inFig. 7. The hardness of Co5alloy increased about by 32% from 154 ± 3 HV to 204 ± 4 HV with annealing due to precipitation of hard Cr-rich sigma phase. This is in accordance with Tsai's work, in which it was found that the hardness of the Al0.3CrFe1.5MnNi0.5HEA nearly triples after the formation of sigma phase[23], since sigma phase is a very hard phase[53]. For the Co10alloy, the hardness increased marginally by about 5% from 147 ± 4 HV to 155 ± 4 HV which is much smaller compared with the Co5alloy, due to the smaller volume fraction of sigma phase. In contrast to the Co5and Co10alloys, the hardness of Co20alloy decreased slightly from about 153 ± 4 HV to about 143 ± 4 HV with annealing. The decreasing trend of hardness with annealing agreed with Salishchec's result[54], in which it was found the hardness of CoCrFeNi and CoCrFeNiMn decreased after annealing even with the same FCC phase and this might be attributed to the more homogeneous distribution of the constituting elements during annealing. Besides, grain growth during annealing may also lead to the hardness decrease[25].Fig. 8shows the tensile engineering stress-strain curves of the three alloys in as-cast and annealed state at 850 °C for 48 h, respectively. For the Co5alloy, the yield strength increased significantly by about 34.7% from about 210 MPa to about 283 MPa after annealing. The increase of yield strength is consistent with the hardness variation[55]. In contrast, the tensile elongation decreases from about 56.8% to 9.6%. The increase of yield strength and decrease of tensile elongation are due to precipitation of hard yet brittle sigma phase. For the Co10alloy, the yield strength increases marginally from about 205 MPa to 216 MPa and the increase extent is much smaller compared with the Co5alloy due to a much smaller volume fraction of sigma phase for the annealed Co10alloy. However, in contrast to the variation of hardness and yield strength, the small volume fraction of sigma phase in the annealed Co10alloy could deteriorate the ductility significantly and the tensile elongation decreases from about 60.7% to 27.8%. For the Co20alloy, the yield strength exhibits a very subtle decrease from about 215 MPa to 208 MPa, and the decreasing trend of yield strength is in accord with the hardness evolution. In contrast to the Co5and Co10alloys, the tensile elongation of Co20alloy keeps almost unchanged after annealing since the alloy still remains a single FCC phase and no brittle sigma phase precipitates. The nearly constant tensile elongation after annealing is in good accord with Salischev's[54]results, which indicated that the annealing did not have apparent effect on the tensile elongation.","['fig7', 'fig8']",[]
4,Conclusion,"The microstructure and phase stability of (FeNiCrMn)(100−x)Cox(x= 5, 10 and 20) alloys annealed at 850 °C were investigated.
