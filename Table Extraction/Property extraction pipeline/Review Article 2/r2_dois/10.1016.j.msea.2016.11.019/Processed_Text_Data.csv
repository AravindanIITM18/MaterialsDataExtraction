0,Abstract,"AlxCrFeNi eutectic multi-component alloys were prepared to obtain excellent mechanical properties by double-phase strengthening. The X-ray diffraction results showed that the crystal structure were both body-centered cubic and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer identified that the two phases are ordered NiAl intermetallic and disordered [Fe, Cr] solid solution. The formation of eutectic structures was introduced by a simplified dynamic model. After mechanical tests, the alloys presented excellent compressive strength and unexpected large deformation. Due to the solid solution and fine-grain strengthening resulted by Al addition, mechanical properties of AlxCrFeNi alloys exhibited regularity in some degree. Among all alloys, Al1.3CrFeNi has the highest fracture strength and Al0.9CrFeNi has the most excellent strain. Besides, Al1.2CrFeNi alloy showed a good combination of strength and ductility.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High entropy alloys (HEAs) or multi-component alloys, which were introduced by Yeh et al.[1]and Cantor el al.[2]in 2004, have attracted much attention across the world. Due to the excellent properties like high mechanical strength and ductility[3–6], good oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures[7,8]and various physical properties[9,10], HEAs show a bright future in the application of metal fields and could relieve the imbalance between the development of new alloys and the expansion of metallic application.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In the initial investigation of HEA, this alloy was defined as super single solid solution alloy with five or more component elements. However, this definition of HEA has been expanding relatively. In addition to single solid solution alloys, multi solid solutions with a mixture of BCC, FCC and even HCP, mixture of solid solution and intermetallic phases, are also belong to the concept of HEAs[11,12]. In order to distinguish the HEAs between single solid solution and duplex phases, Lu et al.[13]proposed a novel concept of HEA according to the analysis of eutectic alloys and named as eutectic high entropy alloy (EHEA). Using this new concept, researchers successfully designed EHEAs with an excellent combination of fracture strength and ductility[14], which shows that EHEA is a new way to improve and adjust properties of HEAs.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Considering the cost of alloys, Co-free AlxCrFeNi eutectic multi-component alloys were prepared in this paper according to the design criteria of EHEAs[13,15]. In the present paper, the microstructures and phases were investigated, and the formation of eutectic phases was introduced combined by a simplified dynamic model. What's more, it is found that the mechanical properties of alloys like compressive properties were improved by regulating the Al content, and the strengthening mechanism was discussed.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"In the processing of AlxCrFeNi (x=0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 denoted as Al09, Al10, Al11, Al12, Al13, respectively) alloy shown in this paper, the ingots were manufactured by arc melting elemental ingredients with purity higher than 99.9% wt% under a protective argon atmosphere inside a water-cooled copper crucible. All samples were re-melted five times to ensure the chemical homogeneity.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,The X-ray measurements of the crystal structure and phase composition were performed using a D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffraction (XRD). The scanning range of 2θ was from 20° to 105° at a speed of 6°/min and the typical radiation condition was 40kV and 30mA with a copper target. The microstructure was examined by a Nova Nano 430 scanning electron microscope (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer (EDS). The differential scanning calorimeter (DSC) test by a Netzsch STA 449 F3 was conducted from 25to 1500°C under the atmosphere of N2.,[],[]

3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructure and phases," Fig. 1 presents the XRD patterns of AlxCrFeNi (x=0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3) alloys. Only body centered cubic (BCC) diffraction peaks are shown but two phases are detected. The minor (100) superlattice diffraction peak represents the formation of the ordered BCC (designate as B2) phase. The overlapping peaks of the BCC phases indicate that the lattice parameters of the alloys are close to each other. Singh[16]has indicated that this superposition of diffraction peaks of XRD patterns is mainly resulted by spinodal decomposition, which is quite common in the multi-component elememt alloy system. Under the effect of spinodal decomposition, the crystal structures of the two phases are the same. Meanwhile, their lattice parameters are similar as well.",['f0005'],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructure and phases,"It should be noted that for conventional alloys, plate-like phases with growth direction is a remarkable feature of eutectic alloys. However, this characteristic has been weakened in the multi-component alloys (≥4). In the previous papers[17–20], researchers also considered the alloys with eutectic-like phases dispersed randomly as eutectic multi-compotent alloys. In Fig. 2(a) , typical regular lamellar eutectic strucuture of Al09 is apparently shown. The closed rectangle area is the grain boundary of this alloy, which is presented in Fig. 2(b)  at a high magnification. It is observed that the phase near grain boundary is dense lamellar structure. The typical eutectic cell microstructures of Al10 and Al11 are presented in Fig. 2 (c–f) respectively. Both of them have similar plate-like phases. Compared with Al09 alloy, other alloys show a intergration trend of grain boundaries. From Fig. 2(g) , it should be noted that Al12 obtains the smallest columnar grains. As shown in the the micrographs at low magnifications, when the x value increased from 0.9 to 1.2, the grains changed from large grains to small ones. For Al09 alloy, the columnar grains are approximately 80µm wide and 150µm long. The Al10 and Al11 alloys also have columnar grains and the average size of the two is mainly 80–30µm and 50–20µm. When the x value increases to 1.2, finest grains are obtained and the average size is in the range of 20–10µm. However, with an increase in Al content, the microstructure morphology transformed to dendritic grains, as shwon in Fig. 2(i) . Besides, the integration of the grain boundaries has almost completed for Al13 alloy.","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructure and phases,"In order to identify whether the AlxCrFeNi alloys are eutectic alloys or not, DSC tests were conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 3 .",['f0015'],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructure and phases,"From Fig. 3 , it is indicated that there are no typical endothermic or exothermic peaks under 1500°C except the melting endothermic peaks during the temperature rising process. This means that no phase change occurs until melting, which could prove the existence of eutectic phase in some degree.",['f0015'],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructure and phases,"The morphology images of the matrix at high magnifications are shown in Fig. 4 . Each of them has a periodic, micron scaled, maze-shaped microstructure. Compared with other typical EHEAs, the biggest difference is that many lamellas intersects leads to the net like structure without certain directions. Though having strange structures, AlxCrFeNi still can be considered as eutectic alloys according to the results of DSC in Fig. 3 . As presented in Fig. 4 , the maze-shaped phases are resulted by the spinodal decomposition, which matches the results obtained in Fig. 1 . About the spinodal decomposition in as-cast state, many researchers have discussed in the multi-component alloys including high entropy alloys. Singh et al.[21]and Santodonato et al.[22]thought that the periodic plate-like modulated microstructure of as-cast HEAs was a characteristic feature of spinodal decomposition. What’ more, Tong et al.[23]have previously identified that similar modulated phases like ordered B2 phase in as-cast state were attributed to spinodal decomposition. The typical rod-like phases formed in these alloys exhibit mainly two orthogonal solidification orientations. Similar to the grain size of AlxCrFeNi alloys, the spinodal decomposition structures of Al12 alloy is the finest. Table 1 list s the chemical composition of phases in AlxCrFeNi alloys. It can be seen that all phases are enriched in Al and Ni and the atomic ratio is nearly 1: 1. Combined with the analysis of XRD in Fig. 1 , this spinodal decomposition phase is NiAl-type intermetallic compound with a ordered B2 strucuture. For AlCrFeNi alloy, Dong[24]and Wang[25]has concluded that the eutectic phase is the conbination of NiAl intermetallic compound and [Fe, Cr] solid solution. Because of the almost same diffraction peaks of Al09-Al13, it is convinced that all these alloys contain the same phases-the mixture of NiAl with ordered B2 structure and [Fe, Cr] solid solution with disordered BCC structure.","['f0020', 'f0015', 'f0020', 'f0005', 'f0005']",['t0005']
3.1,Results and discussion.Microstructure and phases,"In addition, it should be noted that the whole eutectic phases presented in Fig. 4 contain much more Al/Ni than Cr/Fe according to the EDS results in Table 1 . So where do [Fe, Cr] go? In order to illustrate this phenomenon, we thus suppose a simplified dynamic model of forming eutectic structures during solidification, which is presented in Fig. 5 . It is well known that the mixing enthalpy of the atomic paris is a significant factor affecting the combination between two atoms. According to the chemical mixing enthalpies of elements[26], it is clearly shown that the enthalpy of Al-Ni is the lowest. Besides, theoretical studies using abinitiomolecular dynamics simulations (AIMD)[12,27]and CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) method[28]have predicted the preferred interatomic interaction of Al-Ni and Cr-Fe pairs in the liquid supersaturated state, which has been proved in this paper. At a temperature, the instability of spinodal decomposition occurs. This will result in the formation of solute-depletion zone with Cr/Fe and the solute-rich regions with Al/Ni. Once the atomic concentration reaches some level, the ordering of Al and Ni occurs. Finally, equilibrium phases with ordered NiAl and disordered [Fe, Cr] solid solution will be obtained. In the experimental part, we have mentioned that the SEM samples were etched with aqua regia. In this period, the etched phase is mainly [Fe, Cr]. After aqua regia dissolves this solid solution, regular dense skeleton enriched with NiAl is remained as shown in Fig. 4 .","['f0020', 'f0025', 'f0020']",['t0005']
3.2,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"The compressive stress-strain curves of AlxCrFeNi alloys at room temperature are shown in Fig. 6 , and Table 2 presents the values of the yield strengthσ0.2, fracture strengthσband plastic strainεpat different Al contents. All AlxCrFeNi alloys exhibit high yield strength (>700MPa) and fracture strength (>3000MPa). Meanwhile, fairly high plastic strain (>20%) is also obtained. When the Al content increases from x=0.9 to x=1.1, the yield strength increases from 770.0 to 1044.0MPa, and the fracture strength increases from 3002.4 to 3513.0MPa. At the same time, the plastic strain of Al0.9-1.1CrFeNi alloys decreases from 37.1% to 27.1%. As a BCC-steady element, it is easy to see that additional Al leads to the increase of strength and the decrease of ductility. But the alloy with more Al about x=1.2 shows both higher strength (σ0.2=906.8MPa,σb=3607.6MPa) and higher ductility (εp=31.4%) abnormally. With further increasing the Al content, Al13 has the highest fracture strength of 3705.3MPa and lowest plastic strain of 24.7%.",['f0030'],['t0010']
3.2,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"As illustrated in Fig. 6 , it can be considered that the mechanical properties of AlxCrFeNi alloys are influenced by similar factors and consistent variation trend with Al content increasing is presented. In the previous works of HEAs, it has been well known that the crystal structure has a significant effect on the mechanical properties of HEAs. HEAs with BCC structures usually have better strength and lower ductility than HEAs with FCC structures. In this work, Fig. 1 presents that AlxCrFeNi alloys have only BCC structures, which indicates that the effect of crystal structures on mechanical properties can be neglected. Based on the analysis of microstructures of AlxCrFeNi alloys, it can be inferred the varieties of mechanical properties with Al addition primarily results from the following two aspects: solid solution strengthening and fine grain strengthening.","['f0030', 'f0005']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"In the HEAs with solid solutions, each atom of component elements can be considered as a solute atom, which has the equal chance to occupy different locations of crystal lattices. And so is the Al addition. In addition to combine to the Ni and form ordered B2 NiAl phases, extra atoms of Al also can dissolve into the disordered BCC [Fe, Cr] solid solutions. However, compared with other atoms like Cr and Fe, Al owns the maximum atom radius. After solute atoms of Al dissolve into the solid solution, severe lattice distortion occurs to keep the lowest energy of the whole lattice system. In this period, the pinning of dislocation may hinder the dislocation movements, which leads to the increase of strength and the decrease of ductility.",[],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"However, it should be noted that the mechanical properties of Al12 are irregular among AlxCrFeNi alloys. From Fig. 6 , Al12 shows not only higher strength but also higher ductility than Al11. This can’t be explained only by solid-solution strengthening. In Fig. 2 , when the x value increases from 1.1 to 1.2, the grains become finer and more boundaries of grains are observed. It is known that more boundaries the alloy contains, higher resistance of deformation it has. Thus the increasing strength of Al12 is resulted by both solid-solution and fine-grain strengthening. Fig. 4 shows the uniform microstructures of the matrix and Al12 presents more dense morphology compared with other alloys. This means that Al12 has the capacity of distributing the deformation and stress concentration more uniformly, which can suffer much more deformation without cracking and breakage.","['f0030', 'f0010', 'f0020']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"Besides, the change of mechanical properties can also be explained by the morphology and volume fractions of the two phases. In Fig. 2 (low magnification), we can find that the grain size decreases with the increase of Al. Besides, the Fig. 4 shows that the lamellar structures of the matrix are also affected by Al addition and exhibits a dense trend.","['f0010', 'f0020']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"Because of the similar structures and lattice parameters, it is not easy to obtain the volume fractions of two phases from XRD patterns. But generally speaking, the areas of different zones in BSE images can also reflect the volume fractions of phases., BSE images of Al09-Al13 alloys are shown in Fig. 7 . The light zone is the phase enriched with [Fe, Cr], and the dark zone is enriched with NiAl. After area calculation, the area fractions of the two areas are listed as follows:",['f0035'],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"In Table 3 , it can be concluded that the NiAl decreases and [Fe, Cr] increases with Al addition. When the content of Al increases, solid solution strengthening becomes stronger and leads to the strengthening of mechanical properties like compressive strength.",[],['t0015']
3.2,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"In order to make a comparison, Fig. 8 demonstrates the compressive properties of AlxCrFeNi and some other typical HEAs[14,24,29–35], and the data are presented in Table 4 . From Fig. 8 , it is concluded that AlxCrFeNi alloys have relatively high strength, and the ductility of AlxCrFeNi is lower than the HEAs with FCC phases. However, it should be noted that as alloys with duplex BCC structures, it is incredible for AlxCrFeNi to have excellent ductility compared with the presented HEAs with BCC phases. This means that AlxCrFeNi alloys have a good combination of strength and ductility among the typical HEAs shown in Fig. 8 .","['f0040', 'f0040', 'f0040']",['t0020']
3.2,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"From Fig. 8 , we can see that it is very meaningful to conduct this investigation of these alloys. On the one hand, compared to other HEAs, AlxCrFeNi contain less component elements and excellent mechanical properties, which means that the quaternary alloys have less cost of production and more potential in future application. On the other hand, the double-phase strengthening mechanism could provide some references to enhance the properties of multi-component alloys like HEAs.",['f0040'],[]
4,Conclusion,"In this paper, AlxCrFeNi multi-component alloys were prepared by arc-melting method. The XRD showed that there were ordered B2 and disordered BCC phases. These two phases were identified to be NiAl and [Fe, Cr] by EDS. From SEM images, it could be observed that the morphology of alloys were eutectic-like structures. The following DSC results of only melting endothermic peaks proved that they were indeed eutectic alloys though there were no obvious growth directions of plate-like phases. Besides, we attempted to introduce the process of eutectic formation in brief by a simplified dynamic model.",[],[]
4,Conclusion,"Compared to some other HEAs with BCC structures, AlxCrFeNi alloys exhibited excellent compressive strength and unexpected ductility. With the increase of Al, strengthening effect of solid solution become stronger and led to the rising strengthen and decreasing deformation. Because of the fine-grain strengthening, Al1.2CrFeNi alloy presented a good combination of strength and ductility among this series of alloys.",[],[]
