0,Abstract,"A successful demonstration of applying integrated strengthening using Hall-Petch strengthening (grains size effect) and precipitation strengthening is shown in the fcc based high entropy alloy (HEA) Al0.3CoCrFeNi, leading to quantitative determinations of the Hall-Petch coefficients for both hardness and tensile yield strength, as well as the enhancements in the yield strength from two distinct types of ordered precipitates, L12 and B2. An excellent combination of yield strength (~490MPa), ultimate tensile strength (~850MPa), and ductility (~45% elongation) was achieved by optimizing and coupling both strengthening mechanisms, resulting from a refined grain size as well as both L12 and B2 ordered precipitates. This opens up new avenues for the future development of HEAs, with the appropriate balance of properties required for engineering applications.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs) were originally defined as single phase solid solutions[1–4]consisting of at least five principal elements in equimolar ratios with elemental compositions typically between 5 and 35 atomic percent (at.%). These alloy systems have fascinated many researchers in last decade, especially due to their remarkable mechanical strength, resistance to corrosion and creep properties[3–7]. In spite of complex compositions these alloy systems have often displayed simple microstructures and crystal structures due to high entropy of mixing. However it should be noted that if N is the number of alloying elements, the entropy of mixing increases as N ln N, whereas the chances to form chemical order at lower temperatures which depends on the interacting pairs increases with N2, which is much faster. Thus, investigations of chemical and structural stability of these alloys and the unique structure-property relationship are alone intriguing. The deformation results, in particular, have an imperative engineering role.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The superior thermal stability of HEAs has been explained by the sluggish-long range diffusion[8], due to absence of any major diffusing element and the requirement of cooperative diffusion of atoms of different species to facilitate appropriate structural partitioning. Therefore processes like crystallization, grain growth, precipitation etc. which are inherently diffusion dependent are also expected to be slow in these systems.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Refractory high entropy alloys (body centered cubic crystal structure) have offered strength value as high as ~1.4GPa[9]mainly owing to solid solution strengthening. In case of face-centered cubic (fcc) HEAs yield strength values have mostly been in the range of 150–350MPa at room temperature[10,11].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"A recent article by He et al.[12]discussed the applicability of various strengthening mechanism like solid solution, grain boundary, dislocation, precipitation strengthening etc. in Al/Ti containing CoCrFeNi based high entropy alloys. The authors showed an increase of ~325MPa in yield strength due to precipitation strengthening (Ni-Al-Ti based ordered L12precipitates) and further increment of ~300MPa due to added grain boundary and dislocation strengthening. Recent work by Lu et al.[13,14]has shown the strengthening due to L12 and B2 phases in a near eutectic and eutectic alloy based on the AlCoCrFeNix system. In their report the combination of the softer fcc/L12phase together with the harder B2 phase resulted in a combination of well-balanced strength and ductility.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"To examine the grain growth kinetics & microstructure stability in HEAs and their influence on structural properties, we selected Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy with a single fcc structure for the current study. A demonstrative approach to grain size optimization and its influence on hardness and yield strength is presented in this study. Further strengthening beyond just increasing the grain boundary area can be achieved by dislocation pinning by fine-scale precipitates. Strengthening due to formation of fine-scale secondary phase is also clearly presented in this study. A combined effect of coherent intra-granular fine scale precipitates and semi-coherent or incoherent intergranular precipitates coupled with grain boundary strengthening was found to boost the yield strength value without much compromise on ductility.",[],[]
2,Materials and methods,"Alloy with nominal chemical composition Al0.3CoCrFeNi was prepared by a conventional arc melting route and microstructural characterization was performed using scanning electron microscopy (FEI Nova-NanoSEM 230™), coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) detectors and transmission electron microscopy (FEI Tecnai G2 TF20™ operating at 200kV). TEM lifted-out samples were prepared using an FEI Nova 200 dual beam focused ion beam (FIB). The alloy was cold rolled by 90%, were encapsulated in quartz tubes backfilled with argon and solutionized at 950°C (1223K) for 5min, 10min, 15min and 30min, at 1075°C (1348K) for 10min, 30min, 45min, 60min, 90min and 120min and at 1150°C (1423K) for 2min, 5min, 30min and 60min followed by water quenching to obtain a variety of grain sizes. The grain sizes were measured using the TSL OIM™ software for analyzing grain maps obtained from EBSD data. Samples solutionized at 1150°C for 60 min were aged at 550°C for 150h and 700°C for 50h and water quenched to study the precipitation of secondary phases within the fcc matrix. After microstructural analysis, an optimized solution treatment was carried out at 1150°C for 2 min followed by aging at 620°C for 50h and subsequently water quenched. The room-temperature Vickers microhardness was measured with a load of 10N, and at least 10 points were tested on each sample. The tensile tests were carried out by setting the initial strain rate at 10−3s−1, with respect to change in length. For each test performed, the strain rate variation was noted to be less than 1% from the desired strain rate. These tests are quasi-static tests which used a LVDT (linear variable displacement transformer) extensometer. These tensile test specimens (gauge length ~3mm, width ~1mm and thickness ~0.5–1mm) were machined from the heat-treated samples using electric discharge machine (EDM). At least four independent tensile tests, on four different tensile specimens, were carried out to obtain the tensile elongation and strength datasets. The synchrotron transmission –X-ray diffraction experiments was performed on the 11-IDC beam-line (111keV, λ=0.11165Å) of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National laboratory (ANL) on specimens with dimensions of 5mm×5mm×0.5mm (thickness). A CeO2 standard (NIST diffraction intensity standard set: 674a) was used to calibrate the distance between sample and the 2D detector, the detector tilting angle, and position of the beam center. The scattered radiation was collected on a Perkin Elmer 2D detector system. The 2D diffraction data were integrated and converted to an intensity vs. two-theta (2θ) plot using the program Fit-2D.",[],[]
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 1 show a series of representative pseudo-colored orientation imaging microscopy (OIM) grain maps, acquired using standard EBSD techniques. The figure exhibits the grain size evolution as a function of temperature at 950, 1075 and 1150°C for different aging time periods (5 min to 120 min). The grain size distribution (area fraction (AF) on y axis versus the grain size (μm) on x axis) is shown in the inset of each OIM map. The grain size distribution in some cases varies from a random distribution that could be due to variations in the recrystallization mechanisms of these complex HEA alloys as a function of composition and temperature. This requires further detailed analysis and is beyond the scope of the present study. Therefore, in the present study the average grain diameter was used for developing the Hall-Petch relationships for hardness and tensile yield strength for the Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA. The grain size increases with aging time and temperature, and grains grow more rapidly as the aging temperature increases. The resulting grain sizes are listed in Table 1 . The Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy exhibits a singlefccstructure before and after high-temperature aging[15], for all combinations of temperatures and times. The effect of grain coarsening was evaluated via Vickers microhardness measurements. Within the current range of grain sizes, the hardness values closely follow the classical Hall–Petch relationship[16]as shown in Fig. 2 .(1)Hv=Hvo+KHvd−1/2where Hvois the intrinsic hardness of the alloy, d is the average grain size and KHvis the Hall–Petch coefficient. The Hall–Petch coefficient KHvfor the Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy, which is the slope of the curve, was determined to be 227Hvμm0.5. The intercept of the curve (Hvo), which denotes the hardness of an infinitely large grained material, is 111 Hv for this alloy. Z. Wu et al.[17]have shown the change in Hall-Petch intercept and Hall-Petch slope on going from pure Ni (intercept=69 Hv, slope=34Hvμm0.5) to Ni-Co (intercept=62 Hv, slope=167Hvμm0.5) to Ni-Fe-Co (intercept=97 Hv, slope=131Hvμm0.5) to Fe-Ni-Co-Cr (intercept=118 Hv, slope=165Hvμm0.5). The addition of Al to Fe-Ni-Co-Cr, case of the alloy in the present study, has further increased the slope from 165Hvμm0.5to 227Hvμm0.5. Sriharitha et al.[18]have discussed the effect of Al on increasing the hardness in the AlxCoCrCuFeNi system.","['f0005', 'f0010']",['t0005']
3,Results and discussion,"Additionally, the effect of grain size on the tensile yield strength (YS), has been independently investigated via tensile tests, carried out for three different grain sizes. The corresponding stress-strain plots are shown in Fig. 3(a) . The alloy possesses an excellent strain-hardening capability and thus exhibits very high ductility. The YS increased from ~160MPa to ~260MPa by Hall-Petch strengthening due to grain size reduction as shown in Fig. 3(b) . A summary of YS, UTS and elongation to fracture for various heat treatments is shown in Table 2 . The tensile yield strength can also be expressed using a Hall-Petch relationship as given below:(2)σHP=σ0+Kσd−1/2","['f0015', 'f0015']",['t0010']
3,Results and discussion,"Based on Eq.(2), the Hall-Petch coefficient, Kσand intrinsic yield strength of the alloy σ0, were calculated to be 824MPa (μm0.5) and 95MPa respectively. Otto et al.[11]reported Kσto be 538MPa (μm0.5) and 494MPa (μm0.5) at −196°C and 25°C respectively for the CoCrFeMnNi HEA. Stepanov et al.[19]reported a Kσvalue of 935MPa (μm0.5) for CoCrFeMnNi HEA containing 1 at % C suggesting a very pronounced increase due to addition of carbon. The current alloy, which is interstitial free, also shows a high value for Kσsimilar to the recent report[19].",['fo0010'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"Since the Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA is amenable to precipitation of ordered phases, as reported earlier[9,10,20–23], the influence of such precipitation on further strengthening of this alloy has been investigated. A relatively larger initial grain size was chosen to investigate the potential influence of precipitation strengthening in this alloy. The solution treated (1150°C/60min) microstructure consists of a single phase fcc which is evident from the selected area electron diffraction (SAED) patterns ( Fig. 4(a)  and (b)) exhibiting solely the fundamentalfccspots in the [001] and [011] zone axes respectively. Fig. 4(c)  shows the TEM results from the 550°C/150h aged condition. Extra super lattice reflections are observed at {001} and {011} positions in the [011]fcczone axis as shown in the inset in Fig. 4(c)  indicating the presence of L12ordering within thefcclattice. The dark-field image recorded from a {001} super-lattice reflection (marked on the inset diffraction pattern) is shown in Fig. 4(c) . Fine scale L12ordered precipitates are uniformly distributed within the matrix. Figs. 4 (d–h) show the results from the 700°C/50h aged condition where the fine scale globular L12precipitates have dissolved but a morphologically different phase is seen in the SEM image ( Fig. 4(d) ), largely in the vicinity of grain boundaries. This SEM image shows a grain boundary triple junction, with a grain boundary phase and lath-like precipitates within the matrix near the boundary (higher magnification image shown as an inset of Fig. 4(d) ). A FIB lift out was made from a region marked by the red box in the SEM image. Fig. 4(e)  shows the bright field TEM image of the grain boundary and near grain boundary region. The ordered spots are absent in the SAED patterns corresponding to ZA=[112]fccand [011]fcc, shown in Fig. 4(f)  & (g) recorded from the matrix region away from the lath-like precipitates. The SAED pattern from one of the lath-like precipitates is shown as an inset in Fig. 4(h)  which can be consistently indexed as the [011] ZA diffraction pattern of the B2 phase. More details regarding the precipitation of the ordered B2 phase in this alloy have been reported elsewhere[15].","['f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020']",[]
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 5 shows the stress-strain plots from three different heat treatment conditions, solution treated (1150°C/60min), followed by aging at 550°C/150h and 700°C/50h. The increase in yield and tensile strengths after precipitation of the ordered phases is evident from these stress-strain plots. Both yield strength (YS) and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) are observed to increase after the aging treatments as shown in Fig. 5 . The YS increased from ~159MPa to ~285MPa in case of the 550°C/150h aging and from ~159MPa to ~215MPa in case of the 700°C/50h aging. UTS increased from ~410MPa to ~540MPa in case of 550°C aging and to ~520MPa in case of 700°C aging. Therefore, the improvement in YS due to second phase precipitation within thefccmatrix was ∆σ~126MPa for the L12precipitates, and ∆σ~56MPa for the B2 precipitates. It should be noted that the yield strength enhancements reported in this section for L12and B2 precipitates, correspond to relatively larger fcc grain sizes resulting from the longer solution treatment time (1150°C/60min). Since this alloy clearly exhibits grain boundary strengthening, the coupled effect of Hall-Petch strengthening and precipitation strengthening can potentially be exploited more effectively. Based on these results, it is possible to formulate a new expression for the yield strength of these alloys as shown below:(3)σy=σ0+Kσd−1/2+ΔσL12+ΔσB2where, ΔσL12and ΔσB2correspond to the increase in the yield strength resulting from the L12and B2 precipitates respectively. Thus, reducing the fcc grain size in the matrix for this alloy and subsequently precipitation hardening, involving both types of ordered precipitates (L12and B2), could potentially lead to higher yield and ultimate tensile strengths.","['f0025', 'f0025']",[]
3,Results and discussion,"Therefore, an optimized solutionization temperature with a fully recrystallized but finer grain structure was chosen and subjected to subsequent precipitation annealing/aging treatment. The aging temperature was also strategically chosen to potentially achieve strengthening via a combination of both coherent fine scale precipitates of L12within the fcc matrix and semi-coherent or incoherent grain boundary or near grain boundary precipitation of B2. An as cast and homogenized sample of the Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy, after 90% cold rolling was subsequently recrystallized at 1150°C for 2 min, followed by aging at 620°C for 50h. The synchrotron X-ray diffraction results from the as recrystallized/solutionized condition and the recrystallized/solutionized plus aged (620°C for 50h) condition are shown in Fig. 6 . It can be noticed that in the as solutionized condition only the fundamental fcc diffraction peaks are observed, while in the solutionized plus aged condition, extra superlattice peaks are clearly visible. These superlattice peaks correspond to the L12and B2 phases, and can be accordingly indexed in the X-ray diffraction pattern. Fig. 6 also shows insets of the corresponding BSE - SEM images from these two conditions where grain boundary precipitation is observed in the solutionized plus aged condition (1150°C for 2min+620°C for 50h). These grain boundary precipitates are likely to be B2 precipitates, based on their morphology and contrast, and comparing them with similar precipitates observed in case of 700°C/50h aging ( Fig. 2(h) ). The tensile mechanical behavior of these two conditions is shown in Fig. 7 . It should be noted that the stress-strain plot for the as recrystallized/solutionized has already been shown in Fig. 2(a) , but is being repeated in Fig. 7 for comparison of the mechanical properties, before and after precipitation. The solution treated plus aged condition (CR+1150°C/2min+620°C/50h) shows a substantial improvement in YS (~490MPa), while maintaining a high ductility (~45%) ( Table 2 ). Such a remarkable combination of YS and ductility is noteworthy for an fcc-based HEA. Additionally, it should be noted that while the Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy has been widely investigated in the literature[9,10,18–21], the combined effect of Hall-Petch strengthening and precipitation hardening (via two distinct types of ordered precipitates) has not yet been exploited.","['f0030', 'f0030', 'f0010', 'f0035', 'f0010', 'f0035']",['t0010']
3,Results and discussion,"Based on Eq.(3), for a fcc grain size ~25μm for the new aging condition, and assuming similar strengthening effects from the L12and B2 precipitates, as discussed previously, the expected yield strength of the solutionized plus aged condition (CR+1150°C/2mins+620°C/50h) Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy would be:(4)σy=263σ0+Kσd−1/2+126ΔσL12+56ΔσB2=445MPa",['fo0015'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"The experimentally observed yield strength is ~490MPa, which is in reasonably good agreement with the predicted yield strength from Eq.(4)above. Additionally, it should be noted that the expected or computed value of the yield strength is based on strength enhancements from the L12and B2 precipitates that were measured at 550°C and 700°C respectively. The 620°C/50h aging could potentially result in a different volume fraction and size distribution of these ordered precipitates and requires more detailed investigation. With a reduction in the matrix grain size, the grain boundary surface area per unit volume will increase, and consequently the volume fraction of B2 precipitates is also expected to increase. Therefore, the matrix grain size can have an indirect influence on the precipitation behavior in this alloy. Furthermore, there is the likelihood of additional strengthening mechanisms that have not been accounted for in the present analysis. Nevertheless, the approach outlined in this study, of employing the coupled effect of Hall-Petch strengthening from finer recrystallized grains, and two different types of ordered precipitates, one homogeneously distributed within the fcc matrix (L12) and the second one (B2) concentrated at, or in the vicinity of, grain boundaries, can lead to substantial enhancements in yield and ultimate tensile strengths while maintaining excellent levels of ductility in these HEAs. This ultimately results in a better balance of properties that is critical for engineering applications.",['fo0020'],[]
3,Results and discussion,"The B2 precipitates appear to be largely nucleating at or in the vicinity of the matrix grain boundaries, at 700°C/50h, as shown in Fig. 4(d) . Any substantial B2 precipitation in case of the 550°C/150h aged sample was not seen. However, a combination of both γ′ precipitates and grain boundary B2 precipitates in case of the 620°C/50h aged sample (refer Fig. 6 ). The underlying rationale for the selective precipitation of γ′ at 550°C and B2 at 700°C, is not well understood. However, since the B2 preferentially forms at or near grain boundaries, it is likely to have a higher nucleation barrier as compared to the intra-granular homogeneously nucleated γ′ precipitates. Consequently, at 550°C there is a competition between γ′ precipitation versus B2 precipitation and the former dominates presumably due to the lower nucleation barrier. However, since no γ′ precipitates are observed at 700°C, it is likely that this phase has been de-stabilized (above the solvus temperature), and consequently only B2 precipitation is observed at or near the matrix grain boundaries. Detailed thermodynamic analysis and modeling (using a CALPHAD based approach) of the competition between γ′ precipitation versus B2 precipitation is the subject of future research.","['f0020', 'f0030']",[]
3,Results and discussion,"With regards to the influence of these two types of precipitates on the mechanical properties, both γ′ and B2 precipitates individually result in increments in the yield strength (YS) of this alloy. γ′ precipitation leads to a ~78% enhancement in YS while B2 precipitation leads to a ~35% enhancement in YS. Therefore, γ′ precipitation appears to be more effective in strengthening. However, it should be noted that while γ′ precipitates are highly refined and nucleate homogeneously throughout the matrix grains, the B2 precipitates are more localized to the grain boundary regions. Furthermore, these B2 precipitates are coarser and appear to have semi-coherent interfaces with the matrix. Therefore, it can be concluded that the combined precipitation of both types of precipitates is probably an effective mechanism for achieving higher strength, as was demonstrated in case of the 620°C/50h annealed sample.",[],[]
4,Summary,"Summarizing, a methodical study of Hall-Petch strengthening, resulting from grain size, and precipitation strengthening from two different types of ordered precipitates, was carried out in anfccbased, precipitation hardenable, Al0.3CrCoFeNi HEA. Both hardness and tensile yield strength of this alloy exhibit the classical Hall–Petch relationship, though the experimentally determined hardening coefficient is substantially larger than that obtained in conventionalfccmetals[23–25]. The additional strengthening contributions from two types of ordered precipitates, L12and B2, have been independently determined, and the results have been used to develop a new annealing/aging strategy that can take advantage of both types of ordered precipitates simultaneously. The results of this coupled effect of both L12and B2 precipitates and a finer recrystallized grain size within the same microstructure, are very impressive, resulting in an excellent combination of yield strength (~490), ultimate tensile strength (~840), and ductility (~45% elongation). The experimental results and their quantitative analysis, presented in this study, can potentially be employed to design an HEA with the optimum combination of Hall-Petch and precipitation strengthening mechanisms. This opens up new avenues for the future development of HEAs for engineering applications.",[],[]
