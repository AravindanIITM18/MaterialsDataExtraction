f0005,articles_test/10.1016.j.matdes.2017.02.072/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,"The OIM maps showing the grain size evolution as a function of temperature at 1223K, 1348K and 1423K for different aging time periods (5min to 120min) in Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy. The grain size distribution plots (area fraction (AF) on y axis vs grain size (μm) on x axis) is shown in the inset of each OIM map,"
f0010,articles_test/10.1016.j.matdes.2017.02.072/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,Vickers hardness (Hv) as a function of root squared grain size (μm−1/2) in the Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy.

f0020,articles_test/10.1016.j.matdes.2017.02.072/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,(a and b)TEM SADP from [001]fccand [011]fcczone axis from solution aged (SA) condition (1150°C/60min) respectively (c) TEM-dark-field image recorded from a {001} superlattice reflection (marked on the inset diffraction pattern) in SA+550°C/150h condition (d) SEM BSED image from SA+700°C/50h condition from a grain boundary triple junction showing the lath like precipitates (Higher magnification image shown as an inset) (e) the bright field TEM image of the grain boundary and near grain boundary region lifted out from a rectangular region highlighted in (d) in SA+700°C/50h condition. (f)–(g) TEM SADP from [112]fccand [011]fcczone axis from a region highlighted in (e). (h) TEM-dark-field image recorded from a {001} superlattice reflection (marked on the inset diffraction pattern) in SA+700°C/150h condition. The SADP in inset can be consistently indexed as the [011] ZA diffraction pattern from a B2 phase.
