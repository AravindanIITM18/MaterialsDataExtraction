The alloys were prepared by arc melting (the I                        x                      alloys) and injection casting assisted by liquid nitrogen (the R                        x                      alloys). Both the phase structure of I                        x                      and R                        x                      alloys evolved from FCC to FCC + BCC dual-phase, and finally to a BCC phase with an increase in the Al content, and the microstructure transformed from columnar dendrite to equiaxed grain correspondingly. The x range of the R                        x                      alloys with dual-phase structure is smaller than that of the I                        x                      alloys. The R                        x                      alloys also exhibited smaller grain size and spinodal decomposition plate than the I                        x                      alloys. Additionally, because of the microstructure refinement and/or phase structure change, both the hardness and yield stress of R                        x                      alloys were higher than the I                        x                      alloys.

1,Introduction,"UP to date, many kinds of high entropy alloys (HEAs) with 5–9 principal elements have been designed for obtaining unique properties, such as superior room temperature mechanical properties[1–5], considerable wear resistance[6], and good thermal stability[7]. The Al-Cr-Fe-Co-Ni-Cu HEAs were studied extensively focusing on the effect of composition on the microstructure and properties[7–13]. The microstructure of AlxCrFeCoNiCu (x: molar ratio) HEA gradually changed from FCC to FCC + BCC, and finally to BCC phase with the Al content increased from 0 to 3.0, thereby altering the mechanical properties from “soft” to “hard”[7]. For pursuing favorable properties, ceramic reinforcement or non-metallic element was introduced in this HEA system. After adding 10 vol % TiC, both the hardness and yield stress of FeCrNiCoAl0.75Cu0.25HEA were almost twice as before, while the fracture strain decreased obviously[9]. The yield stress of Al0.5CoCrCuFeNiSixHEAs increased firstly and then decreased with thexincreased from 0 to 0.4, and then to 0.8[12]. However, it was found that the increase of strength was always accompanied by the deterioration of plasticity. The strength and plasticity could not match well. Therefore, the element contents and preparation methods were adjusted to overcome the strength-plasticity trade-off.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The solid solution phase in the as-cast HEAs were considered to be metastable essentially[14,15]. The microstructure and mechanical behavior of alloys with metastable structure could be significantly influenced by cooling rate, such as metallic glass[16–18]. Therefore, cooling rate regulation could be used to adjust the properties of HEAs based on the typical sluggish diffusion kinetics. Actually, the influence of cooling rate on microstructure and properties of HEAs with a single phase structure has been reported[19–21]. The AlCoCrFeNi HEA kept BCC structure but showed a slight strength increase accompanied by a plasticity decrease with the cooling rate increase[19]. In addition, high cooling rate decreased the element segregation and dendrite size of the Al30Ti30Co10Ni10Fe20HEA with a BCC structure and the Al10Ti10Co35Ni25Fe20HEA with a FCC structure[21]. However, the effects of cooling rate on the microstructure and mechanical properties of dual-phase and multi-phase HEAs are still unclear.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In the present work, the AlxSi0.2CrFeCoNiCu1−x(0 ≤x≤ 1) HEAs were prepared by arc melting and injection casting assisted by liquid nitrogen, respectively. The effect of cooling rate on the phase structure, microstructure, and mechanical properties of the present alloys were discussed in detail.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedure,"The alloy ingots with nominal composition of AlxSi0.2CrFeCoNiCu1−x(x: molar ratio;x= 0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, and 0.9) were prepared by arc melting the mixture of constituent elements with a purity better than 99.9 wt % in a high-purity argon atmosphere. The ingots were melted at least four times to ensure chemical homogeneity. One part of these ingots were denoted as the Ixalloys, and the other part were re-melted and injected into a liquid nitrogen cooled copper mold with diameter of 4 mm, and denoted as the Rxalloys. The cooling rates of the Ixand Rxalloys are determined to be ∼10K/s[22]and >100K/s[23], respectively.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedure,The phase structure of alloys was examined by Bruker AXS D8 Advance X-ray diffraction (XRD) with a Cu Kα radiation. The microstructure of alloys was investigated by Axio observer A1m metallographic microscope (OM) and Hitachi S4800 scanning electron microscope (SEM). The detailed phase identification was characterized by JEOL JEM-2100 transmission electron microscope (TEM) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Thin-foil TEM specimens were prepared by room temperature ion milling. The hardness of alloys was measured by LECO LM700AT Vickers hardness machine. The room temperature quasi-static compressive mechanical property of alloys was measured by CMT4305 testing machine with a strain rate of 1 × 10−3s−1. The quasi-static compressive specimens were 4 mm in diameter and 6 mm in length. Three tests were performed for a set of specimens to ensure the accuracy of data.,[],[]
3.1,Results.Phase structure,"Fig. 1shows the XRD patterns of the Ixand Rxalloys. Both the phase structure of the Ixand Rxalloys evolved from FCC to FCC + BCC dual-phase, and then to a BCC phase with an increase in the Al content. In addition,Fig. 1(a) shows that the I0.4-0.6alloys consisted of FCC and BCC phases with different volume fractions. However, for the Rxalloys, only the R0.5alloy exhibited FCC + BCC dual-phase structure, the R0.4and R0.6alloy displayed FCC and BCC structure, respectively, as shown inFig. 1(b). The specific volume fractions of each phase in the Ixand Rxalloys were listed inTable 1. It can be seen fromFig. 1andTable 1that thexrange of Rxalloys with the FCC + BCC dual-phase structure is smaller than that of the Ixalloys.","['fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1']","['tbl1', 'tbl1']"
3.2,Results.Microstructure,"Fig. 2shows the OM micrographs of the Ixand Rxalloys. As shown inFig. 2, both the microstructure of Ixand Rxalloys gradually transformed from columnar dendrite to equiaxed grain with an increase in the Al content.Fig. 2(a1-a3) show that the I0.2-0.5alloys exhibited typical columnar dendrite microstructure. Compared with the I0.2alloy, the primary dendrite of the I0.4alloy became shorter and exhibited more diverse crystallographic orientations. The columnar dendrite of the I0.5alloy further degenerated and became more complex.Fig. 2(a4) shows that the I0.6alloy displayed a Widmanstätten side plate microstructure. With the continuing increase of Al content, the I0.8-0.9alloys showed typical equiaxed grain microstructure, and the grain size gradually decreased, as shown inFig. 2(a5-a6). The R0.6alloy exhibited an equiaxed grain microstructure (Fig. 2. (b4)), which is obviously different from the I0.6alloy. Except the R0.6alloy, the other Rxalloys showed nearly the same but finer microstructure compared with the Ixalloys (Fig. 2(b1-b3, b5-b6)).","['fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2']",[]
3.2,Results.Microstructure,"In order to further investigate the microstructure of alloys with typical phase structure, the SEM images of the I0.2/R0.2(FCC structure), I0.5/R0.5(FCC + BCC dual-phase structure), and I0.9/R0.9(BCC structure) alloys with a relative high magnification were presented inFig. 3. It was found that although these alloys exhibited different microstructure as shown in the OM micrographs (Fig. 2), nearly similar maze-shaped spinodal decomposition (SD) plate microstructure with nano-scale size was found in all of these alloys, as seen inFig. 3. For the I0.2/R0.2and I0.5/R0.5alloys, the SD microstructure merely formed in the inter-dendrite (ID) region, as shown inFig. 3(a1-a2, b1-b2). However, for the I0.9/R0.9alloys, the SD plates formed in the whole region, as shown inFig. 3(a3, b3). Compared with the Ixalloys, the Rxalloys exhibited finer SD plates.","['fig3', 'fig2', 'fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3']",[]
3.2,Results.Microstructure,"Fig. 4shows the bright-field (BF) TEM images and the corresponding SAED patterns of the alloys presented inFig. 3. As shown inFig. 4(a1, b1), the dendrite (DR) and ID regions in the I0.2/R0.2alloys were identified as disordered FCC phase (A1 structure) and ordered FCC phase (L12structure), respectively. Whenx= 0.5, as shown inFig. 4(a2, b2), both the ID regions in the I0.5and R0.5alloys were ordered BCC phase (B2 structure). Thus, the phase separation was considered to occur in both the FCC and BCC-based ID regions with a SD plate microstructure.Fig. 4(a3, b3) show that both the I0.9and R0.9alloys exhibited B2 structure, and the nano-scaled SD plates were observed within the entire region of alloys.","['fig4', 'fig3', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4']",[]
3.3,Results.Mechanical properties,"Fig. 5shows the hardness of the Ixand Rxalloys. When the Al content increased from 0.2 to 0.9, the hardness of the Ixalloy increased form 217 HV to 620 HV, and the hardness of the Rxalloys improved from 287 HV to 659 HV. Apparently, the alloys with BCC structure displayed higher hardness than the alloys having single FCC or dual-phase structure. In addition, the hardness of the Rxalloys was evidently higher than that of the Ixalloys, which is attributed to the effect of cooling rate on the microstructure and/or phase structure. The increase rates were 32%, 5%, 13%, 62%, 10%, and 7% in turn with an increase in the Al content from 0.2 to 0.9. The minimum increase rate appeared whenx= 0.4, and the maximum one appeared whenx= 0.6.",['fig5'],[]
3.3,Results.Mechanical properties,"Fig. 6shows the typical engineering stress-strain curves of the Ixand Rxalloys under quasi-static compression at room temperature, and the yield stress, compression strength, and fracture strain of the Ixand Rxalloys are shown inFig. 7correspondingly. When the Al content increased from 0.2 to 0.9, both the yield stress of the Ixand Rxalloys increased, while the compression strength and fracture strain of the two kinds of alloys showed a trend of first decrease and then increase. By comparison, the Ixand the Rxalloys could be divided into two groups: the alloys in Group I (including the I0.2-0.6and R0.2-0.5alloys) exhibited increasing yield stress but decreasing plasticity with the Al content increase, whereas for the alloys in Group II (including the I0.8-0.9and R0.6-0.9alloys), the yield stress, compression strength and plasticity increased with an increase in the Al content. Compared with the Ixalloys, the Rxalloys exhibited higher yield stress, and the lowest (4%) and highest (82%) increase rates appeared whenx= 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. The rule that the yield stress as a function ofxvalue was nearly similar to the relationship between the hardness andxvalue (Fig. 5).","['fig6', 'fig7', 'fig5']",[]
3.3,Results.Mechanical properties,"Fig. 8shows the fracture mode of the Ixand Rxalloys (x> 0.4) under quasi-static compression at room temperature. Whenx= 0.5, 0.8, and 0.9, the Rxalloys nearly show the same fracture mode as the Ixalloys. Both the I0.5and R0.5alloys failed by shearing fracture, as shown inFig. 8(a1, b1). The angles between the fracture surface and cross section (marked by the red lines) were found to be ∼45° in these two alloys. Typical river-like patterns were observed on the shearing surface, as shown in the corresponding high magnification images. Whenx= 0.8 and 0.9, the alloys exhibited a mixed mode of shearing fracture and axial splitting, as shown inFig. 8(a3-a4, b3-b4). Both the shearing and splitting fracture characteristics could be observed. The shearing surface appeared between the cracks along the transverse direction, while most cracks propagated along the axial direction. The appreciable amounts of cleavage steps were observed on the splitting surface. However, as shown inFig. 8(a2, b2), the I0.6and the R0.6alloy displayed totally different fracture mode. The I0.6alloy showed a shearing fracture mode, while the R0.6alloy exhibited a mixed fracture mode.","['fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Effect of cooling rate on phase structure,"As seen inFig. 1, with the Al content increased from 0.2 to 0.9, both the phase structure of the Ixand Rxalloys changed from FCC to FCC + BCC dual-phase, and finally to a BCC phase. The similar trend was also reported by Wang et al.[24]. The atomic radius of Al element (1.43 Å) is obviously larger than other elements, such as Fe, Co, Cr, and Ni (<1.28 Å). Therefore, when the Al element was added, the diffraction peak of the FCC and/or BCC phase gradually shifted to lower 2θ, which indicates that the original elemental crystal expanded and the lattice parameters increased[24]. Then the lattice strain, calculated by the changing lattice parameters, was used to evaluate the extent of lattice distortion. According to Egami's atomic level stress theory, when the volume strain of lattice exceeded the critical value, the original elemental crystal became unstable and then the phase transformation occurred[25]. Therefore, when the lattice strain exceeded the critical value with the increasing Al content, both the phase structure of the Ixand Rxalloys transformed from FCC to BCC phase. In addition, as a potent FCC stabilizer[7,8,19], the decreasing of Cu element is also favorable to the formation of BCC phase.",['fig1'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Effect of cooling rate on phase structure,"In addition,Fig. 1shows that the R0.4and R0.6alloys preferred to form FCC and BCC phase respectively, rather than the dual-phase structure as the I0.4and I0.6alloys, which is owing to the cooling rate-related sluggish diffusion effect in HEAs. Generally, in diffusion-type phase transformation, the different atomic species are required to move cooperatively, so that the diffusion element could pass through the lattice easily to reduce the Gibbs energy of alloy system. However, compared with the conventional alloys, the severely distorted lattice in HEAs may make the atom more difficult to diffuse[1]. Yeh et al.[11]reported that the temperature normalized activation energyQ/Tm(whereQis the activation energy,Tmis the solidus temperature for pure metals or alloys) of CrMn0.5FeCoNi HEA at temperatures between 1173 and 1373 K was higher than pure metals or Fe-Cr-Ni alloys, which confirmed the significant sluggish diffusion effect in HEAs. In addition, the high cooling rate could effectively hinder the diffusion of constituent elements such as Al, Ti, and Ni, which further enhances the sluggish diffusion effect in HEAs[21]. For the R0.4and R0.6alloys, the movement of constituent elements such as Al and Cu was restrained because of the high cooling rate, inducing that the formation of BCC in the R0.4alloy and FCC phase in the R0.6alloy was inhibited, respectively. Therefore, thexrange of the Rxalloys with dual-phase structure is smaller than that of the Ixalloys.",['fig1'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Effect of cooling rate on microstructure,"As shown inFig. 2, the I0.6alloy exhibited a Widmanstätten side plate microstructure, which was totally different with other alloys. The microstructure of the I0.6alloy was found to be close to the AlCoCrFeNi2.1HEA that exhibited the same dual-phase structure as the I0.6alloy[26]. The AlCoCrFeNi2.1HEA had a eutectic composition. Thus, it is speculated that, the composition of the I0.6alloy may be also close to the eutectic point. This may be the reason why the I0.6alloy exhibited a plate microstructure. By comparison, the R0.6alloy exhibited a fully different microstructure from the I0.6alloy, which is attributed to the higher cooling rate. For the alloys with a near eutectic composition, especially for the HEAs with sluggish diffusion effect, the high cooling rate would change the solidification from equilibrium to a non-equilibrium state, inhibiting the formation of typical plate eutectic microstructure. For the R0.6alloy, the diffusion of the Al content was inhibited by the high cooling rate, inhibiting the formation of the FCC phase. Therefore, the R0.6alloy exhibited a single phase structure (Fig. 1. (b)) with an equiaxed grain microstructure (Fig. 2. (a4)), rather than a dual-phase structure with a Widmanstätten side plate microstructure as the I0.6alloy.","['fig2', 'fig1', 'fig2']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Effect of cooling rate on microstructure,"Fig. 3shows the maze-shaped SD plate microstructure with nano-scale size in the I0.2/R0.2, I0.5/R0.5, and I0.9/R0.9alloys. SD microstructure has been found in many HEAs[8,13,27–29]. Generally, SD is regarded to be a destabilization and decomposition process of the supersaturated solid solution. Once an infinitesimal composition fluctuation occurred in the supersaturated solid solution, the fluctuation would continue until the solid solution formed a dual-phase with same structure but different components. The formation of SD microstructure needs to satisfy two conditions. Firstly, the alloy system processes a miscibility gap; secondly, the alloy system forms a supersaturated solid solution with. The SD microstructure is common in conventional Fe-Ni, Cu-Ni, Cu-Ni-Fe, Cu-Ni-Cr, or Al-Cr-Fe-Ni alloy with the miscibility gap. The present Al-Co-Cr-Cu-Fe-Ni-Si HEAs contain the elements mentioned above, indicating that the present alloys also process the miscibility gap. Additionally, because of the sluggish diffusion effect, the present alloys with multiple principal elements are liable to form supersaturated solid solution. Therefore, all of these alloys exhibited the maze-shaped SD plate microstructure.",['fig3'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Effect of cooling rate on microstructure,"Compared with the Ixalloys, the Rxalloys exhibited a finer microstructure, as shown inFigs. 2–4. This phenomenon is similar to the conventional alloys. For instance, the dendrite size and arm spacing of the Al2024 alloy decreased with the cooling rate increase[30]. Generally, the high cooling rate could stimulate more potential nucleation sites for the primary phase by increasing the undercooling degree, which effectively restricted the growing space of grains[31]. In addition, the high cooling rate could impact the diffusion kinetics, which hinders the migration of grain/phase boundary by inhibiting the movement of the constituent elements[21]. Therefore, the grain size and SD plates of Rxalloys were smaller than the Ixalloys.","['fig2', 'fig3', 'fig4']",[]
4.3,Discussion.Effect of cooling rate on mechanical properties,"Combined the results shown inFigs. 5–7, both of the hardness and yield stress of Ixand Rxalloys increased with an increase in the Al content, which is mainly attributed to the phase structure of alloys changed from “soft” FCC phase to “hard” BCC phase[32]. Therefore, the alloys in Group II exhibited higher hardness and yield stress by comparison with that in Group I. In addition, the alloys in Group I exhibited decreasing plasticity with the Al content increase, because the phase structure of alloys transformed from FCC phase to dual-phase. On the contrary, the alloys in Group II displayed increasing compression strength and plasticity with an increase in the Al content, which is owning to the gradually decreasing grain size, as shown inFig. 2. According to the Hall-Petch relation, the smaller grain size means more grain boundaries or phase boundaries, and these boundaries are conducive to hindering the movement of dislocation. Consequently, both the plasticity and compression strength of alloys in Group II obviously increased with an increase in the Al content.","['fig2', 'fig5', 'fig6', 'fig7']",[]
4.3,Discussion.Effect of cooling rate on mechanical properties,"Both the hardness and yield stress of Rxalloys were higher than the Ixalloys (Figs. 5 and 7), which is ascribed to the phase structure and/or the microstructure variation of alloys with the cooling rate increase. For the alloys that had the same phase structure, including I0.2/R0.2, I0.5/R0.5, I0.8/R0.8, and I0.9/R0.9alloys, the Rxalloys displayed a finer microstructure than the Ixalloys, as shown inFig. 2. Therefore, the Rxalloys displayed higher hardness and yield stress than the Ixalloys because of the fine-grain strengthening effect. However, whenx= 0.6, the I0.6alloy exhibited a FCC + BCC dual-phase structure, but the R0.6alloy showed a BCC phase structure (Fig. 1). The volume fraction of the BCC phase increased from 67% in I0.6alloy to 100% in R0.6alloy. Therefore, the hardness and yield stress of the R0.6alloy were obviously higher than the I0.6alloy, and the increase rate of hardness and yield stress between the R0.6and the I0.6alloys was obviously higher than other alloys. According to the above explanation, the R0.4alloy exhibited a single FCC structure while the I0.4alloy consists of FCC + BCC dual-phase (Fig. 1), thus the I0.4alloy should exhibit greater hardness and yield stress than the R0.4alloy. However, on the contrary, the hardness and yield stress of the I0.4alloy slightly decreased compared with the R0.4alloy. The illogical performance is mainly attributed to the variation of microstructure. Apparently, as shown inFig. 2, the R0.4alloy displayed finer columnar dendrite than the I0.4alloy, which was beneficial to yield stress and plasticity improving. Considering that the volume fraction difference of the BCC phase between the I0.4and R0.4alloy was merely 13%, therefore, the fine-grain strengthening effect is deemed to dominate in competition with the softening effect induced by the phase structure change.","['fig2', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig2', 'fig5', 'fig7']",[]
4.3,Discussion.Effect of cooling rate on mechanical properties,"For those alloys with the same phase structure, includingx= 0.5, 0.8, and 0.9, the Rxalloys show the same fracture modes as the Ixalloys, as shown inFig. 8. However, the I0.6and R0.6alloys exhibited different phase structure and micro-morphology, correspondingly, obviously different fracture modes between them were observed (Fig. 8(a2, b2)). The I0.6alloy showed a shearing fracture mode. The angle between the fracture surface and cross section were found to be ∼50°. However, the R0.6alloy exhibited a mixed fracture mode that consumed more energy than the single shear fracture mode. Both the cracks along the transverse direction and the axial direction were observed, and the angles between the fracture surface and cross section were ∼40° and ∼70°, respectively.","['fig8', 'fig8']",[]
