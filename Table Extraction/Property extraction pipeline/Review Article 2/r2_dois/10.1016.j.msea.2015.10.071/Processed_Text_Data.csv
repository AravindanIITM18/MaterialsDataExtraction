0,Abstract,"The novel quaternary Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 (at.%) high entropy alloy with dual-phase structure was developed and cast by arc melting of elemental precursors. The as-cast state comprised of lamellar eutectics with alternating α(Sc, Zr) with HCP lattice plates having thickness of 30–50nm, length up to 600nm and inter-lamellar spacing of 5–40nm, embedded in the β-NbZrTi matrix with BCC structure. While the α(Sc, Zr) plates showed reduced content of Nb, the β-NbZrTi matrix was particularly depleted in Sc. The unique mixture of fine hexagonal α(Sc, Zr) plates within the β-NbTiZr matrix in as-cast state led to relatively high combination of strength and ductility: the alloy with initial hardness of 418 HV reached compressive strength of 1250MPa, yield strength of 1020MPa and compressibility of 8.2%. The phase composition exhibited high stability with no significant changes taking place after annealing at 1000˚C for 24h. The high-temperature exposure caused only coarsening of α(Sc, Zr) hexagonal plates, which reached 3μm in width and 5-10μm in length. The plastic strain of the annealed alloy with hardness of 202 HV increased to 20% while compression strength decreased to 670MPa. As opposed to the as-cast state, the annealed alloy exhibited limited strain hardening during room-temperature compression.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High entropy alloys (HEAs) have induced a lot of interest as a new candidate for next generation of advanced engineering materials. In contrast to conventional alloys involving one or two major elements, the HEAs contain all of their elemental components in near-equiatomic concentrations[1–3]. As a result of their unique microstructure, HEAs offer a wide range of valuable properties including high-temperature strength, superior corrosion resistance, low creep or high ductility, which bring solutions to a number of highly challenging applications, particularly in aerospace[4].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The early HEAs explored mainly the single crystallographic lattice. There were examples of sets of four or more elements within groups from III to XII of the periodic table, which crystallized as simple solid solutions of body-centered cubic (BCC)[5]or face-centered cubic (FCC)[6]. A similar phenomenon was revealed for elements with hexagonal close-packed (HCP) lattices[7,8]. Youssef et al.[8]obtained the Al20Li20Mg10Sc20Ti30 (at.%) HEA powder with HCP structure using mechanical synthesis and annealing at 500 °C. Similarly, nearly single HCP structures were found in YGdTbDyLu and GdTbDyTmLu equiatomic alloys[7]. All the above was the result of the fact that single solid solution was easier to generate in those type of alloys since the high entropy might expand the solubility range of certain alloy components[3–9].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The mechanical properties of HEAs generally depend on the type of crystallographic lattice[4, 5]. The HEAs with (BCC) solid solutions, e.g. NbMoTaVW, usually exhibit very high strength at limited plasticity, while alloys with (FCC) solutions, e.g. CoCrFeMnNi, have rather low strength, but high plasticity[3,4,10]. It is generally accepted, that low plastic strain in conventional HCP alloys results from a limited number of slip systems[11]. Thus, a coexistence of FCC and BCC solid solutions in HEAs may allow achieving the optimum combination between the strength and plasticity[3]. Accordingly, to obtain optimum plastic and strength properties, the phase composition of HCP-HEA should also contain the FCC or BCC structure. Such a phase combination could lead to the superior mechanical properties of Ti alloys, similarly to two-phase TiAl6V alloy with HCP and BCC structure[12]. The idea of involving dual phase in high entropy HCP and BCC alloys has been published in[13]for the TiFeCoNi system, apparently exhibiting high mechanical properties. Also Lu et al. reported a similar approach with the eutectic composition of HEA consisting of lamellas of A2 and B2 phases[14].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The overall original concept of this research was to develop novel eutectic alloy with a mixture of relatively plastic BCC and difficult to deform HCP phases in order to achieve a combination of high fracture strength and high ductility. It was achieved by casting the eutectic alloy consisting of Sc, Ti, Zr and Nb elements in equiatomic amounts and to assessing its microstructural details, mechanical properties and behavior during high temperature annealing.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedure,"The quaternary equiatomic HEAs were manufactured from elemental ingredients of Sc, Ti, Zr and Nb of 99.99wt.% purity in an arc melting furnace with water-cooled copper plate under a protective Ar atmosphere. As a getter, high purity Ti was applied. To achieve sufficient homogenization, alloys were re-melted three times. Samples of each batch, with a target weight of 5g and a drop shape, having 6mm in height and 10mm in diameter, were prepared. The chemical composition was determined using the emission optical spectrometer JY 10 000 RF JOBIN YVON. For structural characterization, platelets were sectioned from each drop. The X-ray measurements of the phase composition were performed using a D2 Phaser-Bruker diffractometer and Cu Kα filtered radiation. The microstructure was examined using a scanning electron microscope, FEI SEM XL30 (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometer EDAX GEMINI 4000. The microstructure and selected area electron diffraction pattern (SAED) studies were also performed using the Philips CM20 and Tecnai G2 F20, transmission electron microscopes (TEM). The micro-chemical analysis was conducted using TEM equipment in both transmission and in scanning transmission (STEM) modes coupled with the Integrated Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Samples for TEM were thinned using Struers Tenupol-5 jet polisher in the electrolyte consisting of 20vol.% HClO4and 80vol.% CH3OH at subzero temperatures. The Vickers hardness was measured using a Zwick/ZHU 250 tester under the load of 5kg in accordance with ASTM E92. The compression test was performed following the PN-57/H-04320 standard using an INSTRON 3382 machine and samples with 3mm in diameter and 4.5mm in height.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Development of dual-phase HEAs,"The alloy with equal atomic concentrations of four elements including three with hexagonal structure Sc, Ti, Zr and one with cubic body-centered structure Nb was developed in the present work. The alloy design was based on binary phase diagrams[15]and the Hume-Rothery rule[16]. The Sc-Zr, Ti-Zr and Ti-Nb systems exhibit complete solubility at ambient temperature with the latter showing additionally a variety of Ti allotropic structures depending on Nb content; below 5at.% of Nb–the α-Ti solid solution forms, at 5-50at.% of Nb-coexistence of α-Ti and β-Ti phases occurs, while above 50at.% of Nb the β-Ti structure appears. For the Ti-Sc system, a limited solubility is observed and the α-Ti phase exists below 5at.% of Sc, while the α-Sc solid solution forms at 95at.% of Sc. However, the Nb-Zr system shows nearly complete lack of solubility up to 1000˚C, but at temperatures between 1000 and 1700˚C the α(Zr, Nb) solid solution is formed[15–17]. The proposed elemental precursors of the alloy exhibit either partial or complete solubility in each other at ambient or high temperatures. According to[3,4], the high entropy effect may expand the solubility range of certain alloying elements, but the binary systems give only preliminary hints for alloy designing. Analyzing the selected elements ( Table 1 ,[18–20]) from the point of view of Hume-Rothery rule[16], the differences in atomic radii do not exceed 15%. Also their Pauling electronegativities are close to each other. In contrast, large differences occur in atomic numbers and electron valences. It is known that a metal dissolves in a metal of higher valence to a greater extent than in one of a lower valence. For example, in the Hf25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy, large differences of valences, promote the formation of solid solutions. In the case of Nb, it is known that its physical properties strongly stabilize the BCC structure, as it happens in the Hf33Nb33Zr33[21]and Hf25Nb25Ti25Zr25 alloys[22]. On the other hand, in our previous work, the Hf25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy was developed with the microstructure of purely hexagonal solid solution. Based on findings of this work, the Hf was replaced by the Nb to create the (Nb-Sc-Ti-Zr) quaternary alloy. Simultaneously, since Nb and other elements reveal large differences in their melting temperatures, it can lead to segregation effects and the generation of valuable phases[3].",[],['t0005']
3.1,Results.Development of dual-phase HEAs,"Predicting the type of solid solution in HEAs was a subject of a number of investigations[6,23–24]. They were based mainly on thermodynamic or topological factors[1,5,6,24]such as configuration entropy of mixing (ΔSmix), mixing enthalpy (ΔHmix), valence electron concentration (VEC) or average atomic radius (r). Gao et al.[23]predicted HEA compositions by exploring the ab-initio molecular dynamic method (AIMD). Their study confirmed that neither segregation nor short range ordering should occur in HEAs, while the complex solid solutions, e.g. FCC with B2 phase and σ, are likely to co-exist. The chemical interaction between elements in the liquid state, diffusion coefficients and atomic sizes of alloying elements also play a significant role. The Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy developed in present work has following parameters;ΔSmix= 11.5 (J⋅K−1⋅mol−1),ΔHmix= 9 (kJ⋅mol−1), VEC = 4,δ= 5.87 (atomic size differences),Δχ= 0.11 (electronegativity difference).",[],[]
3.1,Results.Development of dual-phase HEAs,"Therefore, during the initial stages of alloy development, the ternary alloy consisting of Sc, Ti and Zr of hexagonal crystal structure and equal atomic volumes of all elements was cast. For the ternary alloy, marked further as Sc33Ti33Zr33, the measured contents revealed 33.5at.% Sc, 32.9at.% Ti and 33.6at.% Zr. The X-ray diffraction confirmed a dominating presence of hexagonal solid solution with lattice parameters of a=3.2223nm, c=5.0716nm and the space group of P63/mmc. The lattice constants were slightly different from those of individual elements, suggesting a cell distortion. Additionally, weak peaks from another hexagonal structure with lattice constants of a=3.0620nm and c=4.8856nm were detected within the diffraction pattern. The microstructure of the Sc33Ti33Zr33 alloy ( Fig. 1 a) consisted of large grains with the diameter of 100μm with fine lamellar-like morphology present near grain boundaries. While moving towards the center of grains, the surface relief became less pronounced. In as-cast state the alloy average hardness reached up to 235 HV. Alleksanyan et al.[25]obtained in the ternary Ti34Zr33Hf33 system a single HCP solid solution with lattice parameters of a=3.205nm and c=5.095nm. They reported that negligible changes of cell parameters in ternary alloys were related to the presence of elements with similar atomic radii and lattice constants. On the other hand, the BCC solid solution was observed in the Zr33.3Hf33.3Nb33.3 system[26]. According to the equilibrium phase diagram (section at 410˚C), the Nb33.3Ti33.3Zr33.3 alloy should consist of mixture of HCP and BCC structures[27]. The papers published so far suggest that such an approach is correct because strictly planned alloy composition ensures obtaining the desired phase content.",['f0005'],[]
3.2,Results.Phase composition of the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy,"During the next stage of the study, Nb was added to the ternary Sc33Ti33Zr33 system to create the quaternary Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy. The effect of Nb additions on alloy microstructure is shown in Fig. 1 b. The quaternary alloy consists of very fine lamellas with sharp mass contrast, related to changes in local chemical composition. It is a typical microstructure for fast cooling rates associated with inhomogeneity in Nb distribution. Some casting defects were present and dark spherical features were identified as porosity. The key role of solidification conditions was confirmed for FCC and BCC alloys, in which the equiatomic composition created a fine single solid solution with increasing cooling rate[2,28]. In the present work, several batches of the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy were cast using arc melting furnace at cooling rate close to 300˚C/s, which seemed to be not high enough to obtain the single solid solution. The X-ray diffraction analysis revealed two crystallographic structures within the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy ( Fig. 2 ). The first one is the α(Sc, Zr) phase with hexagonal lattice (marked with triangles) of lattice constant (after fitting): a=3.275nm, c=5.168nm and space group P63/mmc. A small deviation of the lattice constant compared with the α(Sc, Zr) phase from the database is due to the presence of other elements with various atomic radii, resulting in the cell distortion. Another phase, marked with black round markers in Fig. 2 , had cubic lattice, space group of Im3m and lattice constant of a=3.3646nm, which indicated the β-NbTiZr phase[29].","['f0005', 'f0010', 'f0010']",[]
3.3,Results.Microstructure and chemical composition of phases,"The transmission electron microscopy observations showed, that matrix grains were filled with colonies of lamellar-like crystallites nucleated at one location and growing outward ( Fig. 3 ), i.e. presenting the microstructure typical for fine eutectic mixtures[30,31]. The typical lamella thickness was from 30 to 50nm, while their length was up to 600nm. The inter-lamellar spacing ranged from 5 to 40nm. The chemical analysis of the lamellas (like the one marked “1” in Fig. 3 ) performed using EDS system confirmed their high content of Sc and Zr and much smaller amount of Ti and Nb ( Table 2 ).","['f0015', 'f0015']",['t0010']
3.3,Results.Microstructure and chemical composition of phases,"Tilting the thin foil helped to reach conditions at which practically all lamellas in the field of view were close to Bragg condition and consequently associated with dark contrast ( Fig. 4 a). The corresponding SAED pattern showed a strong (01-10) and (1-100) reflections (i.e. [0001] zone axis) of the hexagonal α(Sc, Zr) phase presented as insert in Fig. 4 a. The dark-field image ( Fig. 4 b) obtained with the (10-10) reflection marked with a circle in the insert ( Fig. 4 a) confirmed a lamellar microstructure with alternating bands of bright and dark contrast, labeled as “α(Sc, Zr) phase” and “another phase”, respectively. The inter-lamellar spacing was up to 50nm and the α(Sc, Zr) lamella thickness was within 50 to 70nm range. The TEM-EDS chemical composition analysis showed that the Zr content in the lamellas was lower than that given for the α(Sc, Zr) phase in literature[32]. It is believed that the substitution mechanism, in which Nb and Ti with lower atomic radii replace Zr, is responsible both for the observed micro-composition differences and the reduction in the lattice constant. Obtaining Bragg conditions with dark contrast for inter-lamella areas on the same thin foil at another area helped to show, that they were also of the same orientation but much more fragmented filling in the whole available space and therefore acting as the matrix ( Fig. 4 c). The SAED acquired from the inter-lamella spacing was solved as [001] β-NbTiZr phase with BCC lattice. The TEM-DF ( Fig. 4 d) observations performed using one of the (10-1) reflections encircled in the SAED in Fig. 4 c. It confirmed a separate location of the BCC phase in the lamellar structure. The TEM-EDS analysis of the area between two lamellas marked as “2” is shown in Fig. 3 , and is listed in Table 2 . It indicates that the phase was depleted in Sc, and contained nearly equal amounts of Nb, Ti and Zr. This result confirmed that the lamellas and the interlamellar phases differed not only in their lattice symmetry, but also in chemical composition.","['f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0015']",['t0010']
3.3,Results.Microstructure and chemical composition of phases,"Next, the scanning-transmission electron microscopy (STEM) investigations using high angle annular dark field detector (HAADF) sensitive to atomic number (Z) contrast of the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy were performed ( Fig. 5 ). They showed that the β-NbTiZr phase gave lighter contrast indicating that, on average, it was built of heavier atoms than the darker α(Sc, Zr) phase. The accompanying qualitative EDS measurements confirmed that the highest Sc concentration was in the area of plates, while the Nb and Ti located in-between them. Simultaneously, the Zr was distributed at comparable level in both phases. The above results were consistent with the X-ray analysis confirming the presence of two phases: one, the α(Sc, Zr) phase containing mainly HCP elements and another, the β-ZrTiNb phase with the BCC elements. In that way, the eutectic present in the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy was thoroughly described. It is apparent, that it was the alternating nucleation and parallel growth of phases, that resulted in the formation of the lamellar α-ScZr (HCP) and β-NbTiZr (BCC) eutectic labeled “BCC” and “HCP”, respectively. This growth mechanism seems related to different solidification temperatures of individual phases. The nucleation of α-ScZr (HCP) lamellas of higher solidification temperature resulted in depleting of the surrounding area in Sc and enriching it in Ti and Nb stimulating the formation of the α(Sc, Zr) phase of lower solidification temperature.",['f0025'],[]
3.4,Results.Annealing effect on alloy microstructure,"The thermal stability of microstructure and phase composition of the developed alloy was verified by high temperature annealing, i.e. holding at 1000˚C for 24 hours. The X-ray diffraction of the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy subjected to above mentioned heat treatment, shown as the additional difractogram in Fig. 2 , confirmed the presence of the α(Sc, Zr) phase with hexagonal structure and lattice constants of a=3.259nm and c=5.124nm as well as the β-NbTiZr phase with the lattice constant of a=3.357nm, being close to those from the as-cast pattern. The changes in the intensity and width of the α(Sc, Zr) and β-NbTiZr peaks suggest that annealing led to an increase in the alloy grain size and casting stress relaxation. Additionally, a small shift of peaks to lower 2θ values was probably caused by reactivation of segregation processes between phases involved.",['f0010'],[]
3.4,Results.Annealing effect on alloy microstructure,"The microstructure observation of the annealed Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy indicated activity of coarsening processes, which changed lamellas to hexagonal plates of ~3μm width and 5–10μm length. The EDS analysis from the plates marked as”1” in Fig. 6 a, showed the presence of similar high fractions of Sc and Zr contents as in the as-cast material ( Table 3 ). The clean boundary between α(Sc, Zr) and β-NbTiZr without any precipitates ( Fig. 6 b) confirms good temperature phase stability of the investigated material. Similarly, the EDS analysis from the matrix showed mostly the presence of Nb, Ti and Zr (area “2” in Fig. 6 a). It should be noted that the content of Sc in the matrix decreased, even as its amount in the as-cast material was determined with lesser accuracy due to fine size of involved microstructure features and possibility of their overlapping. The point analysis was backed with the map presenting distributions of Nb, Sc, Ti and Zr elements (shown in Fig. 7 b, c, d and e, respectively). It confirmed that major portions of Nb and Ti were present only in the matrix together with Zr ( Fig. 7 e). It was concluded that annealing of the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy led mainly to coarsening of microstructure. According to the phase diagram[15], the α(Sc, Zr) structure should be stable at temperatures up to 1400˚C and then it should transform to the β-(Sc, Zr) phase with FCC lattice. Annealing tests of this study showed that the diffusivity even at so elevated temperature was limited and aimed at attaining stable cubic (Nb) or hexagonal (Ti) structures in the Sc-Zr system.","['f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0035', 'f0035']",['t0015']
3.5,Results.Deformation behavior of as-cast and annealed material,"Results of the compression test of the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy conducted directly after casting (solid line) and after annealing at 1000°C for 24h (dashed line) are plotted in Fig. 8 . The higher properties were achieved for the as-cast state: yield strength of 1020MPa, compression strength of 1250MPa and strain ε=8.2%. The large strain hardening of the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy, resulting in hardness increase from 418 HV to 580 HV, was caused by the generation of high density of dislocations and formation of the complex structure, as seen in Fig. 9 . Such a high deformation resulted in substantial fragmentation of α(Sc, Zr) plates. After deformation, very fine α(Sc, Zr) plates of 50nm thickness were surrounded by the β-NbTiZr phase.","['f0040', 'f0045']",[]
3.5,Results.Deformation behavior of as-cast and annealed material,"The Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy after annealing at 1000°C for 24h underwent a strong coarsening of the α(Sc, Zr) plates in the β-NbZrTi matrix, resulting–accordingly to Hall Patch relationship-in the drop of hardness down to 202 HV. During deformation of as-annealed state, the plastic strain increased by 20%, while compression strength decreased to 670MPa and yield strength reached 310MPa. The hardening effect induced by strain in microstructure (due to dislocation density increases), obtained during the compression test was low, as compared to the deformation of as-cast state which resulted in hardness increase from 202 HV just to 234 HV. Young's module of annealed sample reached 81GPa and was lower at 10GPa in comparison to the state after direct casting",[],[]
4,Discussion,"The original outcome of this study was an elaboration of the dual-phase composition consisting of the α(Sc, Zr) and β-NbZrTi phases in the quaternary Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy.",[],[]
4,Discussion,"According to the Ti-Zr-Nb ternary phase diagram[27], the β-NbTiZr is present in a wide composition field. The addition of Sc affect stability range of β-NbTiZr making the situation even more complicated. The β-NbZrTi phase was reported also in the Nb41Ti39Zr20 and Nb45Ti21Zr34 alloys[27,33]. These two works also showed, that the decrease of Zr content in the Nb37Ti54Zr9 alloy led to the formation of both β-NbTiZr and α-Ti solid solutions, while its increase in the Nb48Ti9Zr43 alloy led to the mixture of the β-NbZrTi and α-Zr phases. These examples indicate that β-NbTiZr could be stable even for non-equimolar concentrations. The β-NbTiZr phase with cubic lattice and the α(Ti, Zr) phase with hexagonal structure were formed also in the Zr60Ti35Nb6 alloy[34], while the NbTi25Zr15 alloy consisted of the α-TiZrNb phase[25,29]. It is believed that as the β-NbTiZr phase grew, the excess of alloying elements led to the formation of other phases, like α-Zr or α(Zr, Ti). In the present study, Sc formed a solid solution with Zr, according to the phase diagram[15], while remaining elements created the β-NbTiZr phase. However, a study of similar Hf25Nb25Ti25Zr25 alloy[22], showed only the presence of BCC solid solution despite the occurrence of three HCP elements. According to another research[29], the Ti20Zr20Hf20Nb20Ta20 alloy exhibited a dendritic BCC structure accompanied by micro-segregations of Ti, Zr and Hf in the inter-dendritic regions. All the above confirms that Nb is a strong stabilizer of the BCC structure. Simultaneously, as reported for Ti35Zr27.5Hf27.5Nb5Ta5 alloy[32], small additions of BCC elements (up to 5at.%), such as Ta and Nb to the Ti-Zr-Hf system induce the phase transformation into the orthorhombic (martensitic) α“-type structure. The addition of Sc to the Nb-Ti-Zr system preserves the phase composition. It is very likely, that a synergy effect in the present Nb-Sc-Ti-Zr quaternary system contributed to the formation of the dual-phase microstructure. At the same time, producing dual-phase solid solutions was strongly enhanced by small additions of certain elements to single phase HEAs.",[],[]
4,Discussion,"The eutectic composition in equiatomic HEAs is known to favor the formation of hexagonal and cubic dual-phase structures. For example, the near-eutectic chemical composition in the Al2CrCuFeNi2HEA resulted in the microstructure consisting of sunflower-like colonies[35]. Simultaneously, a fully eutectic microstructure was observed in the AlCoCrFeNi2.1alloy with fine lamellar microstructure consisting of FCC and B2 phases[36]. Also, a mixture of two phases, FCC and Laves CrCoNb-type was found in the CoCrFeNiNb0.8eutectic HEA[37]. Its phase fraction changed depending on the Nb content. The experiments performed by authors of the present study showed that, additions of Co, Ga and In to the ScTiZr and NbScTiZr alloys, i.e. to the In20Nb20Sc20Ti20Zr20 and Ga20Nb20Sc20Ti20Zr20 as well as Co20Sc20Ti20Zn20Zr20 alloys, brought about the occurrence of several intermetallic phases and cubic as well as hexagonal solid solutions.",[],[]
4,Discussion,"The lattice parameters of phases present in HEAs are usually highly distorted in comparison with elemental cells of their components, as supported by measurements of this study ( Table 1 ). For example, the Hf25Nb25Ti25Zr25 alloy with the BCC structure showed lattice constant a= 3.519nm[22], being higher than that expected for the β-NbTiZr compound[33]. Similar observations were reported for the quaternary TiCrZrNb alloy[38], where the HCP and BCC phases co-existed. In that case, the HCP phase was distributed within interdendritic regions, while the BCC phase constituted the alloy matrix. Lattice distortions measured in the current study were smaller than reported by above mentioned papers the most probably due to the presence of two phases, which allowed for the preferential segregation of alloying elements.",[],['t0005']
4,Discussion,"The mechanical properties of HEAs depends on its phase composition[2,3]. For the Al0.5CoCuCrFeNi HEA with FCC structure the compression strength was 1200MPa at 20% plasticity along with yield stress of 450MPa[3,4]. The high deformation level was possible due to a single FCC structure with high number of slip planes. The similar compression strength of about 1200MPa at very low ductility below 0.5% was observed for the quaternary TaNbWMo HEA due to the presence of BCC structure[31]. In the eutectic AlCoCrFeNi2.1alloys (FCC/B2 structure – small content) tensile strain was merely 75MPa by tensile strength 1186MPa and elongation 22.8%[14]. In recent studies of the eutectic CoCrFeNiNb0.65HEA[37]the mechanical properties improved when the hard Laves phase and ductile FCC solid solution were mixed. Although it is generally known that the Laves phase reduces mechanical properties of alloys due to its brittle nature, in eutectic HEA a combination of microstructure provides the compressive strength of about 2300MPa at 23% ductility and at the hardness of above 500 HV[37]. The combination of relatively high compression strength and ductility of alloy developed in this study ( Fig. 8 ) is due to the unique mixture of fine hexagonal α(Sc, Zr) plates within the β-NbTiZr matrix in the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy in the as-cast state. Our results showed that the proper combination of HCP and BCC phases ( Fig. 2 , Fig. 4 ), being different from Laves intermetallic phases, results in optimum mechanical properties, indicating wide application opportunities.","['f0040', 'f0010', 'f0020']",[]
4,Discussion,"The reduction of mechanical properties of the developed alloy after annealing ( Fig. 8 ) is caused, in part, by different chemical compositions of phases, a ratio between the HCP and BCC structures as well as microstructure coarsening. There is some evidence that the heat-treatment, such as annealing[36]and aging[39]can strongly affect properties of HEAs with FCC, BCC as well as HCP structures[13]. Annealing at 1000 ˚C of the TiFeCoNi HEA with mixture of HPC and FCC structures increased the compressive strength as a result of disordered FCC intermetallic phase among the HCP dendrites[13]. For several high entropy alloys with FCC or BCC structure, annealing led to the precipitation of secondary phases, therefore improving mechanical properties[3,4]. For example, the TiFeCoNi alloy having a two-phase structure of ordered HCP dendrites and interdendritic regions with the mixture of ordered phases with FCC and HCP lattices reached the compressive strength of 1.8GPa at 10% of ductility[13]. On the opposite, for the Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy developed here with α(Sc, Zr) and β-NbZrTi eutectic the precipitation hardening effect did not occur suggesting the steady-state condition of the dual-phase microstructure.",['f0040'],[]

5,Conclusions,"The Nb25Sc25Ti25Zr25 alloy showed high phase stability at high temperatures, i.e. after annealing at 1000˚C for 24h, despite strong coarsening of α(Sc, Zr) hexagonal plates. The plastic strain of the annealed state with hardness 202 HV increased by 20%, while compression strength decreased to 670MPa and yield strength reached 310MPa.",[],[]
