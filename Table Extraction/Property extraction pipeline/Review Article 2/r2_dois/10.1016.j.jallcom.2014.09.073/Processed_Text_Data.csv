The microstructures were investigated using optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy disperse spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy. Compression tests were conducted at room temperature. The present study showed that with increasing Al contents, the phase structures of the alloys changed from FCC+BCC to double BCC as the main phases. Among the alloys studied, all of them exhibit distinguished work hardening. Especially the Al0.5CrFeNiTi0.25 alloy has the highest fracture strength and plastic-strain limit of 3.47GPa and 40%, respectively with a yield strength of 1.88GPa. The observed microstructure is analyzed using CALPHAD calculations.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Recently, high-entropy alloys (HEAs)[1–3], which is based on the concept of the tremendously high configurational entropy of mixing due to the formation of solid solutions of multi-principal elements, have drawn rising interest. HEAs have been reported to possess a series of unique properties, for instance, high hardness[4–8], outstanding wear resistance[9,10], good fatigue resistance characteristics[11], excellent high-temperature strength[12,13], good thermal stability[14], good oxidation[9], and corrosion resistance[15,16]. Research efforts have been undertaken to gain the fundamental understanding of the HEA formation and explore new high-performance HEAs for various applications[17,18,6,19–22]. Ranganathan[23]regarded HEAs, bulk metallic glasses, and rubber metal as the most three breakthroughs alloying theory during the recent decade.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"At present, the research on HEAs is still in the early exploratory stage. Synthesis of new HEAs by traditional trial and error methods has dominated the literature. The effect of addition of the Al content in various HEAs based on 3d-transition metals on their structures, thermodynamics, and mechanical properties has been reviewed and analyzed by Tang et al.[24]. A previous study[5]showed that the AlCoCrFeNiTixalloy system (x=0, 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 in molar ratio) has promising mechanical properties. The dominant phase in the system is the body-centered cubic (BCC) solid solution, and the system possesses excellent room-temperature compression mechanical properties. In particular, AlCoCrFeNiTi0.5has a yield strength, fracture strength, and plastic strain limit as high as 2.26GPa, 3.14GPa, and 23.3%, respectively. Following that study, we have developed a series of new AlxCrFeNiTi0.25alloys, based on the valence electron concentration (VEC) scheme proposed by Guo et al.[25]. The new alloys do not contain expensive Co in order to reduce the alloy cost and has a much lower Ti content to minimize the formation of brittle Laves phase. The objective of the present study is to identify alloys with the optimal combination of strength and ductility in the AlxCrFeNiTi0.25system.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Alloy ingots with nominal composition of AlxCrFeNiTi0.25(x: molar ratio,x=0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0 denoted by Al0, Al0.25, Al0.5, Al0.75, and Al1, respectively) were prepared by arc melting in a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere. The pure elements have a purity higher than 99.6 weight percent. The alloys were remelted at least four times to improve homogeneity. The ingots were then remelted under high vacuum (10−3Pa) and injection cast into a water-cooled copper mould to obtain cylindrical rods ofΦ5×70mm.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,The microstructure of as-cast samples was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD). Samples ofΦ5×10mm for compressive tests were prepared and investigated at room temperature with a strain rate of 2×10−4/s. The fracture surface and the morphology of the alloys were examined with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectrometer. TEM samples were first mechanically ground to 40μm thickness and then thinned using ion milling till perforations. The TEM observations were carried out with a 300keV Tecnai F30 microscope at the Electron Microscopy Laboratory of Peking University.,[],[]
3.1,Results.Microstructures,"The XRD patterns of AlxCrFeNiTi0.25alloys with various Al contents in the as-cast condition are shown in Fig. 1(a) . The main phases identified are face-centered cubic (FCC) and BCC structures. There are minor unidentified peaks at small angles in Al0, and the structure corresponding to those peaks are desirable for the TEM study as the future work. The FCC phase disappears in Al0.5, while two BCC-type phases appear in Al0.5, Al0.75 and Al1. The overlapping peaks of the BCC phases indicate that their lattice parameters are close to each other. The TEM work showed that they are disordered BCC (designated as A2) and NiAl-type ordered BCC (designated as B2) structure, and the details are provided on the TEM paragraph. As indicated in Fig. 1(b) , the lattice parameters of FCC and BCC phases increase with increasing Al contents.","['f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3.1,Results.Microstructures,"The SEM micrographs of the as-cast AlxCrFeNiTi0.25 alloys are shown in Fig. 2 . Typical cast dendrite and interdendrite (defined as DR and ID, respectively) structures were observed. The morphology of dendrites and interdendrites is diverse in the AlxCrFeNiTi0.25alloy system, which suggests that the Al content also affects the growth behavior of dendrites. This trend is expected because the equilibrium phases, and their compositions strongly depend on the Al content in this alloy system. The chemical composition (atomic%) in the dendrite and interdendrite regions of the Al0.5 alloy are listed in Table 1 . Iron and chromium are segregated to the interdendrite region, and the dendrite is enriched in aluminum, nickel, and titanium.",['f0010'],['t0005']
3.1,Results.Microstructures,"The TEM examination of the microstructure of Al0.5 has been conducted, and the results are shown in Fig. 3 . Two types of microstructures are observed: inter-weaved short rods align at about 90° angles ( Fig. 3 a), and nano-particles of irregular shape distribute in a matrix ( Fig. 3 b). The selected area electron diffraction (SAED) pattern [the insert in Fig. 3(a) ] indicate that those rods are ordered BCC phases (about 30nm in width, 100nmin length) with a lattice constant of 0.303nm. The SAED indicates that the nano-particle is the disordered BCC phase with a lattice constant of 0.297nm (the insert in Fig. 3 b). According to Orowan mechanism, these particles with a disordered BCC structure would provide effective dispersing-strengthening effects. The chemical compositions of both structures are analyzed by EDX, as shown in Table 2 . It can be observed that the matrix is enriched in Cr and Fe, while the particles and tiny long precipitates are enriched in Al and Ni. Those two different structures provide both effective precipitation strengthening and nano-composite strengthening effects.","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']",['t0010']
3.2,Results.Mechanical properties," Fig. 4 shows the compression stress–strain curves of AlxCrFeNiTi0.25at different Al contents, and the values of the fracture strength,σb, yield strength,σ0.2, and plastic strain limit,εp,are listed in Table 3 . All AlxCrFeNiTi0.25alloys exhibit fairly high fracture strength (>1,800MPa) and yield strength (>1,300MPa). When thexvalue is lower than 0.5, the fracture strength, yield strength and plastic strain increase with increasing the Al content. Whenx=0.5, the fracture strength and plastic strain achieved the maximum, namely 3,474MPa and 40%, respectively. With further increasing the Al content, both the fracture strength and strain drop rapidly. Note that Al1 shows little ductility with the lowest strength. Furthermore, a comparison with other typical HEAs[26–31]and bulk metallic glasses (BMGs)[29]are summarized in Fig. 5 ,and the data are listed in Table 4 . It seems that Al0.5CrFeNiTi0.25has the most desirable combination of strength and ductility among HEAs materials listed.","['f0020', 'f0025']","['t0015', 't0020']"
3.2,Results.Mechanical properties," Fig. 6 indicates the fracture surfaces of AlxCrFeNiTi0.25alloys. The fracture surface exhibits both apparently featureless regions (a) and regions with a “rock candy” appearance (b). Rock-candy features are a characteristic sign of the intergranular brittle fracture, where the crack path follows along grain boundaries. Many dimple-like features with a size of 3–5μm are observed in (c), which are typically correlated with good plasticity. With a further addition of Al, the dimple-like features gradually decrease, as shown in (d) for Al0.75, and a typical river pattern is observed. As for Al1,the fracture surface shows high-density short tear edges and cleavage steps with little ductility in (e), and these features indicate a cleavage crack in the Al1 alloy.",['f0030'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Effect of removing Co and lowering Ti contents,"New materials design need to consider not only the property enhancement but also the decrease of the alloy cost. In the case of developing HEAs based on CoCrFeMnNi, lowering or removing expensive Co but without negatively impacting the materials properties is particularly useful because it will make these new materials competitive against commercial stainless or even Ni-based super alloys. Removing Co can largely reduce the cost of the alloy, by adjusting the Al contents. The alloy Al0.5CrFeNiTi0.25, seems to possess the best combination of the high fracture strength and high plastic strain among a dozen different alloys, as shown in Fig. 5 . Lowering the Ti content is also shown to be very effective in depressing the formation of the brittle Laves phase.",['f0025'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Effect of Al contents,"The present work shows the addition of Al promotes the BCC-phase formation in the AlxCrFeNiTi0.25alloy system. This trend is in agreement with the work by Tang et al.[24]who reviewed AlxCoCrCuFeNi, AlxCoCrFeNi, AlxCrFe1.5MnNi0.5, AlxCoCrFeNiTi, and AlxCrCuFeNi2alloy systems. Although Al has an FCC structure, it has an atomic radius (1.43Å) that is much larger than Cr, Fe, and Ni (whose radii are about 1.25Å). Subsequently, increasing the lattice constant and large lattice strain results, when Al atoms are introduced to the lattice site of the FCC Ni or Fe. The excessive addition of Al eventually leads to the formation of a BCC structure to minimize the lattice-strain energy. Among the Al–3d transition metals interactions analyzed by Tang et al.[24]using the acronym of CALculation of PHAse Diagram (CALPHAD) method, the B2 type Al–Ni bond is the strongest, which has an enthalpy value of −43kJ/mole of atoms at 800°C, while the enthalpy in the Cr–Al and Fe–Al solid solutions in the BCC or FCC structures are positive. Accordingly, the preference of forming B2-type AlNi is expected in AlxCrFeNiTi0.25alloys with higher Al contents, and such preference introduces alloying-element partitioning among B2, A2, and A1 phases during solidification. This trend is exactly why the dendrites are enriched in Al and Ni, and the interdendrites are enriched in Cr and Fe. In addition, theoretical studies usingab initiomolecular dynamics simulations[1,22](AIMD) predict the preferred interatomic interaction of Al–Ni and Cr–Fe pairs even in the liquid state. In short, the results from the published CALPHAD analysis[24]and AIMD[1,22]simulations are consistent, and are confirmed in the present experiments and others.",[],[]
4.3,Discussion.Phase analysis using CALPHAD modeling,"To assist in analyzing the observed trend in the microstructure and mechanical property of AlxCrFeNiTi0.25, the CALPHAD calculations were carried out using the TCNI6 database supplied with the ThermoCalc software. An isopleth is shown in Fig. 7 . Only phases stable at high temperatures are shown, since they are most relevant to the processing condition of the as-cast ingots. The liquidus temperature increases steadily, as the Al content is increased, suggesting the increased interatomic bonding pertaining to Al (primarily due to the formation of the B2 type structure). During further cooling after primary crystallization, FCC-A1 starts to form in Al0 and Al0.25, and B2 in Al0.5, Al0.75, and Al1. As the temperature is lowered further, Ni3Ti_D024forms in Al0, and H_L21in Al0.25, Al0.5, Al0.75, and Al1. Here Ni3Ti_D024refers to the stable binary hexagonal Ni3Ti phase (Pearson symbol, hP16, Space groupP63/mmc) with very small solubilities of Fe, Cr, and Ni, and H_L21refers to the Heusler phase, AlNi2Ti (Pearson symbol cF16, Space group,Fm3¯m). At 950°C, all alloys are in the solid state, and the equilibrium phases with their mole fractions are listed in Table 5 .",['f0035'],['t0025']
4.3,Discussion.Phase analysis using CALPHAD modeling,"Although the predicted isopleth is of equilibrium in nature, it at least qualitatively explains the observed microstructure. For example, the A2 phase was observed in all 5 alloys as the primary phase. At a fixed temperature of 1,150°C, the phase diagram shows that A1 is stable in Al0 and Al0.25, and not stable in Al0.5 and above. This is in excellent agreement with experiments (see Fig. 1 ).",['f0005'],[]
4.3,Discussion.Phase analysis using CALPHAD modeling,"In terms of the phase composition in Al0.5, equilibrium calculations at 1050°C and 1000°C were carried out, which are slightly below the solidus temperature. Since both FCC and H_L21phases were not observed in the experiments, they were set “dormant” in the calculations to maintain a microstructure of A2+B2. The phase compositions calculated at 1000°C are listed in Table 2 . The excellent agreement for both phases between experiments and modeling demonstrates that the CALPHAD modeling based on reliable thermodynamic databases can be used to predict the phase transition and element partitioning among phases even though the equilibrium solidification is usually not possible during arc/induction/suction melting in a laboratory. Such modeling can be applied to arbitrary virtual alloys to search for ideal compositions that may have the widest phase field of the disordered solid-solution phase of interest (e.g., A1, A2, or A3 for the HEA formation), and, thus, it can accelerate the HEA development (examples are shown in Ref.[22]).",[],['t0010']
4.4,Discussion.Mechanical properties,"The present study showed that the optimal combination of strength and ductility occurs in the alloy with the intermediate Al content, namely Al0.5CrFeNiTi0.25. Alloys with lower or higher Al contents have both lower strength and ductility. Such observation is counterintuitive, since the B2-type NiAl bond that is promoted by the Al addition is much stronger than the A2-type CrFe bond. But the same trend has also been observed in other alloy systems, such as FeCoNi (AlSi)x[30], CoCrFeNiTiAlx[32], AlxNiFeCuCo[33], AlxCoCrFeNiTi0.5[34], and AlxNbTiMoV[35]. Taking CoCrFeNiTiAlx[32]for example, the maximum strength of 2.28GPa was reached whenx=1.0 while the compressive strength decrease gradually to 2.11GPa forx=1.5 and 1.03GPa forx=2.0.",[],[]
4.4,Discussion.Mechanical properties,"The presence of the FCC in a large amount in Al0 and Al0.25 is responsible for the impressive ductility. Al0.25 is stronger because B2 appears and B2 phase is very strong. The presence of cast porosity about 20% percent in Al0 also reduces the strength, because the porosity cannot carry load. If the porosity is avoided, then the yield strength is expected to be higher than 1500MPa. The high-density dimple-shaped structures can be clearly observed in Fig. 6(c) , which suggests large local deformation in Al 0.5 alloy. CALPHAD modeling shows that the B2 phase dominates the microstructure at high temperatures in the solid state (not shown) in Al0.75 and Al1. Brittle fracture along grain boundaries in Al0.75 (see Fig. 6 ) is apparent. Planar fracture combined with tear dominates in Al1. For Al0.75 alloys [as shown in Fig. 6(d) ], the rough facets and river-like patterns indicate the fracture morphology of alloys exhibit to be a typical cleavage fracture, and the flat fracture of the Al1.0 alloy in Fig. 6(e)  indicates its poor ductility. In both Al0.75 and Al1, transgranular fracture did not occur, rather fracture proceeds along paths where atomic bonds are weak, e.g., high-energy defect sites. As a result, despite the dominance of the high-strength B2-NiAl phase, both alloys show lower strength.","['f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030']",[]
4.4,Discussion.Mechanical properties,"It is amazing to note that distinguished work hardening was found during compression test. Due to the large workhardening capacity, these compositions exhibit excellent ultimate strengths. Especially for Al0.5, the ultimate strength is as high as 3474MPa, and the maximum fracture strain is as large as 40%. The large plasticity and distinguished work hardening are accommodated by the inter-woven short rods aligning at about 90 degree angles ( Fig. 3 a), and nano-particles of irregular shape distribute in a matrix ( Fig. 3 b). The nano-particles uniformly distributed in matrix taking up 61% percent can pin down the dislocations effectively, and strengthen the work hardening property at room temperature. Both inter-woven short rod and nano-particles are responsible for the strain improvement and distinguished workhardening capacity.","['f0015', 'f0015']",[]
4.4,Discussion.Mechanical properties,"It is worth noting that the L21phase is stable in Al0.25 and above, as predicted by CALPHAD modeling. The presence of the nano-precipitation of L21in these alloys by proper thermo-mechanical processing is possible. Future work in manipulating the microstructure between A1/A2/B2/L21and, thus, property will be useful to design new alloys with possibly enhanced properties.",[],[]
