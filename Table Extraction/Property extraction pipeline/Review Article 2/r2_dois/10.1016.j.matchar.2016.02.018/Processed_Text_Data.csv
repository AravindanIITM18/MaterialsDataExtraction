0,Abstract,"In this study, Al0                     .5CoCrFexNiTi0.5 alloys (where the molar ratio (x) is 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0) were synthesized to elucidate the effect of their Fe content on their microstructure and mechanical properties. The results show that both Al0.5CoCrFe0.5NiTi0.5 and Al0.5CoCrFe1.0NiTi0.5 alloys consist of four phases, BCC, FCC, σ, and ordered BCC phases. The number of phases decreases to three for the Al0.5CoCrFe1.5NiTi0.5 and Al0.5CoCrFe2.0NiTi0.5 alloys, both of which consist of the FCC, BCC, and ordered BCC phases. The hardness of the alloys decreases from HV748 to HV399 with increasing Fe content. This result shows that addition of Fe to the alloy inhibits the formation of the σ phase while promoting the formation of the FCC phase, and thus indicates that Fe stabilizes the FCC phase. Al0.5CoCrFe0.5NiTi0.5, Al0.5CoCrFe1.0NiTi0.5, and Al0.5CoCrFe1.5NiTi0.5 alloys have a dendritic structure. However, the microstructure of the Al0.5CoCrFe2.0NiTi0.5 alloy changes into a three-phase eutectic structure. The compressive strength (σmax) of the alloys decreases with increasing Fe content. Accordingly, σmax decreases from 2240 to 1736MPa, and the fracture strain increases from 0.11 to 0.45 as the Fe content increases from 0.5 to 2.0. Both Al0.5CoCrFe1.5NiTi0.5 and Al0.5CoCrFe2.0NiTi0.5 alloys exhibit high strength and high ductility.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-entropy alloys, the concept of which was proposed by Yeh et al.[1], are a new domain in the development of alloys. These alloys consist of at least five principal metallic elements, with the concentration of each element ranging from 5 to 35at.%. Because of their high mixing entropy, these alloys tend to form a random solid solution after solidification[2,3]. Previous studies have shown several attractive properties of these alloys, such as easy formation of nanoprecipitates, good thermal stability, high corrosion resistance, and high malleability[1–6].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In AlxCoCrCuFeNi alloys, the crystal structure changes as the Al content increases. These alloys exhibit a single face-centered-cubic (FCC) structure at 0≤x≤0.375, a FCC/body-centered-cubic (BCC) structure at 0.5≤x≤0.75, and a single BCC structure at x=0.875. The hardness of the as-cast alloys increases with increasing Al content, reaching maximum at x=0.875 (HV538)[7]. In this alloy system, however, Cu precipitates very easily and segregates at interdendrite at a normal cooling rate of about 10–20K/s[8]. The resulting Cu-rich phase decreases the pitting resistance by providing local galvanic cells[9]. For this reason, some researchers have designed AlxCoCrFeNi alloys, in which Cu is absent. As the Al content changes, the microstructure transforms into the following: Al0–Al0.3: FCC structure, Al0.5–Al0.7: mixed structure (FCC+spinodal (A2+B2))→FCC+B2 structure, and Al0.9–Al1.2: spinodal (A2+B2) structure. Clearly, Al strongly encourages the formation of the BCC structure in AlxCoCrFeNi alloys, and increasing the Al content increases the alloy hardness[7,10–11]. Because of its large atomic size, Al markedly strengthens its solid solutions. Another large atom that can be added to the alloy design is Ti. AlxCoCrFeNiTi and AlCoCrFeNiTixalloys exhibit a duplex structure consisting of a BCC solid solution and a Ti-rich Laves phase[12–14]. Some alloys for high-temperature applications have been selected and tested after aging treatment. Al0·3CoCrFeNi alloy that has been strengthened by addition of minor amounts of Mo and Ti displays strong age hardening at 700°C[15]. The structure of AlCoCrCuFeNi alloy consists mainly of a BCC phase with a minor FCC phase after 5h of aging below 645°C; the stabilized BCC phase changes to the FCC phase when the temperature exceeds 645°C[16]. The high-entropy alloy Al0·5CoCrNiTi0.5exhibits age hardening at 600 to 900°C and shows no age softening even after aging at 1200°C[17].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Studies on AlCoCrCuFeNi, AlCoCrFeNi, and AlCoCrFeNiTi alloy systems have mainly focused on the effect of the Al, Cu, and Ti content, with several of these studies discussing the effect of Co, Cr, and Ni[18–21]. However, the effect of Fe on the microstructure and properties of high-entropy alloys is not well-researched. For the present study, the Al0·5CoCrNiTi0.5alloy has been chosen to elucidate the effect of Fe addition.",[],[]
2,Material and methods,"Al0·5CoCrFexNiTi0.5high-entropy alloys (where the molar ratios (x) 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, correspond to Fe0.5, Fe1.0, Fe1.5, and Fe2.0, respectively) were synthesized by vacuum arc melting in a copper mold under an argon atmosphere. The alloys were remelted five times to ensure their homogeneity. Commercial-grade elemental Al, Co, Cr, Fe, Ni, and Ti with 99.5% purity were used as the raw materials. The dimensions of each resulting alloy ingot were 62mm×39mm×11mm. The ingot was then cut to 10mm×10mm×2mm flakes for analysis of the crystal structure and microstructure. The microstructure was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM; Hitachi-S4800), and the composition was obtained by energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The crystal structure was studied by X-ray diffraction (XRD; Bruker D8 SSS) using Cu Kαradiation, a scanning rate of 4 degree/min, and a 2θ range of 20–100°. The hardness was measured under a load of 1kg for duration of 15s by using a Future-Tech FM-300e Vickers hardness tester. A compression test under a strain rate of 10−3s−1was carried out on a ϕ5mm×10mm specimen by using a Chun-Yen CY-6040A4 universal tester.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Crystal structure," Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-cast Al0.5CoCrFexNiTi0.5alloys. The Fe0.5and Fe1.0alloys clearly have four phases (ordered BCC, BCC, FCC, and σ phases), whereas the Fe1.5and Fe2.0alloys have three phases (FCC, BCC, and ordered BCC phases). The ordered BCC phase is of the B2 type, with a lattice parameter (a) of 2.930Å and a Pearson symbol (P.S.) of cP2. The BCC phase is of the A2 type, with a=2.881Å and P.S. of cI2. The FCC phase is of the A1 type, with a=3.604Å and P.S. of cF4. The σ phase, a CrFe-like σ phase with PDF-# of 05-0708, is of the D8btype, with a=8.844, c=4.567, c/a=0.516, and P.S. of tP30. The amount of σ phase decreases with increasing Fe content and is absent in the Fe1.5alloy. In contrast, the amount of the FCC phase increases with increasing Fe content. Therefore, the volume fraction of the σ phase decreases, and that of the FCC phase increases after addition of Fe to the alloys. These results indicate that Fe stabilizes the FCC phase and inhibits the formation of the σ phase in Al0·5CoCrFexNiTi0.5alloys. Tsai et al. proposed that σ-phase formation could be predicted from the valence electron concentration (VEC)[22]; the σ phase appears in as-cast or aged high-entropy alloys when the VEC is between 6.88 and 7.84. The VECs of Fe0.5to Fe2.0alloys are 7.48, 7.36, 7.35, and 7.33, respectively. The VECs of the Fe1.5and Fe2.0alloys are within this range. However, they do not have an observable σ phase probably because of the supercooled structure of the as-cast alloy and the σ phase may form in the equilibrium state at higher temperature. According to the Gibbs phase rule, F=C−P+1, the maximum number of phases is 7 for a six-component alloy. However, the XRD results indicate only four phases in the Fe0.5and Fe1.0alloys, and three phases in the Fe1.5and Fe2.0alloys. This observation may be due to the high entropy effect; the mixing entropies of the Fe0.5to Fe2.0alloys are higher than those of conventional alloys. In the present study, the mixing entropies of Fe0.5to Fe2.0alloys are 14.47, 14.55, 14.30, and 13.97kJ/mol, respectively. Guo and Lui[23]proposed that phase stabilization in high-entropy alloys may be predicted from the VEC[24]. At VEC<6.87, the alloy consists solely of the BCC phase; at 6.87≤VEC<8, a BCC/FCC phase results; and at VEC>8, a FCC phase exists. All of the alloys in this work consist of the BCC/FCC phase, which is consistent with the study by Guo and Lui[23]. Overlapping XRD peaks that represent FCC(111) and ordered BCC(110) appeared in all of the alloys, indicating the existence of the Kurdjumov–Sachs relationship FCC(111)//BCC(110) in the mixed phase[24].",['f0005'],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Microstructure," Fig. 2 shows the microstructure of the Al0·5CoCrFexNiTi0.5alloys. Table 1 displays the chemical compositions of the interior structures shown in Fig. 2 , which had been determined by EDS. The Fe0.5to Fe1.5alloys exhibit a dendritic structure, while the Fe2.0alloy shows a fine structure. For the Fe0.5to Fe1.0alloys, the dendrites consist of the BCC, FCC, and σ phases, and the interdendrites have a eutectic structure consisting of the BCC and ordered BCC phases. The BCC phase, indicated by “A” in Fig. 2(b)  and (d), is a (Cr,Fe)-rich phase; the FCC phase, indicated by “B” in Fig. 2(b)  and (d), is a (Ni,Co,Ti)-rich phase; the σ phase, indicated by “C” in Fig. 2(b)  and (d), is a (Cr,Fe)-rich phase; the ordered BCC phase, indicated by “D” in Fig. 2(b)  and (d), is a (Ni,Co,Al,Ti)-rich phase. Differentiation between the BCC and σ phases is based on the Cr and Fe content. For the BCC phase, the sum of the Cr and Fe content is approximately 60at.%, because both Cr and Fe are the BCC structure. For the σ phase, the sum of the Cr and Fe content is approximately 50at.%, which is similar to the CrFe-like σ phase composition. Thus, the σ phase likely corresponds to stoichiometric (Cr,Fe)(Co,Ni,Ti,Al). Similarly, the (Ni,Co,Ti)-rich phase indicates the FCC phase, because both Ni and Co are the FCC structure. Furthermore, the (Ni,Co,Al,Ti)-rich ordered BCC phase is due to the high enthalpy of mixing between (Ni,Co) and (Al,Ti)[25]. Dendrites of the Fe1.5alloy consist of the BCC and FCC phases, with the FCC phase being a (Ni,Fe,Co,Ti)-rich phase. As in the Fe0.5and Fe1.0alloys, interdendrites in the Fe1.5alloy also have a eutectic structure consisting of the BCC and ordered BCC phases. Apparently, the eutectic structure of the interdendrites becomes finer as the Fe molar ratio in the alloy increases. This trend indicates that the interdendrite composition approaches the eutectic point with increasing Fe content. The fine structure of the Fe2.0alloy in Fig. 2(h)  shows a three-phase eutectic structure that consists of a FCC phase, an irregularly shaped BCC phase, and a striplike ordered BCC phase. Both FCC and BCC phases turn into (Fe,Cr,Co,Ni)-rich phases. To distinguish between these two phases, we note that the BCC phase has a higher Al and Ti content. Accordingly, both Al and Ti are strong formers of the BCC phase[26].","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010']",['t0005']
3.3,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties," Fig. 3 presents the hardness of the as-cast Al0·5CoCrFexNiTi0.5alloys. The hardness values of the Fe0.5to Fe2.0alloys are HV730, HV526, HV430, and HV399, respectively. The alloy hardness decreases with increasing Fe content, with Fe0.5to Fe1.5alloys showing a large reduction. According to the XRD and SEM analyses, this phenomenon is caused by the decrease in the volume fraction of the σ phase and the increase in the volume fraction of the FCC phase upon addition of Fe. As the σ phase is a hard, topologically close-packed phase, the alloy is significantly stronger when the σ phase is present. On the other hand, the FCC phase is soft because it has 12 octahedral slip systems with low slip resistance. Therefore, an alloy with more of the FCC phase softens. The primary factor for the large decrease in hardness from the Fe0.5to the Fe1.5alloy is the substantial reduction of the volume fraction of the σ phase; a secondary factor is the continuous increase in the volume fraction of the FCC phase. The decrease in hardness from Fe1.5to Fe2.0alloy is also due to the formation of much more FCC phase.",['f0015'],[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties," Fig. 4 shows true stress–strain curves obtained during compression test on the Al0·5CoCrFexNiTi0.5alloys. The yield strength (σy), compressive strength (σmax), and fracture strain (εf) are shown in Table 2 . Fracture surfaces observed by SEM are shown in Fig. 5 . σydecreases from 1659 to 866MPa with increasing Fe content. Upon addition of the smaller atoms, Fe (0.126nm atomic radius), into the alloy, the solid-solution-strengthening effect caused by the larger atoms, Al (0.143nm atomic radius) and Ti (0.147nm atomic radius), gradually weakens in both BCC and FCC phases. Similarly, σmaxfrom Fe0.5to Fe2.0alloy decreases from 2240 to 1736MPa, and εfincreases from 0.11 to 0.45. These results are caused by a decrease in the σ phase and an increase in the FCC phase with increasing Fe content. Of particular note are the Fe1.5and Fe2.0alloys, which both exhibit high σmaxand εf. The good ductility of these two alloys is attributed to their finer microstructure, which effectively prevents crack growth during compression. As listed in Table 3 , σmaxand εfof the Fe0.5to Fe2.0alloys, especially those of the Fe1.5and Fe2.0alloys, are superior to those of other high-entropy alloys, bulk amorphous alloys, and commercial-grade high-strength stainless steels[13,27–30]. These two alloys thus exhibit great potential use in the development of a structural material with high strength and high ductility.","['f0020', 'f0025']","['t0010', 't0015']"
3.3,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"The fracture surface of the Fe0.5alloy shows numerous cleavage surfaces, which indicate a brittle alloy. The Fe1.0alloy shows a combination of dimpled structures and cleavage surfaces. The dimpled area in the Fe1.5alloy markedly increases, indicating its higher ductility. The fracture surface of the Fe2.0alloy reveals only dimpled structures, again indicating its high ductility. The characteristics of the fracture surfaces agree with the decrease in the εfobserved in the compression test.",[],[]
4,Conclusions,"Al0·5CoCrNiFe0·5Ti0.5to Al0·5CoCrFe1·5NiTi0.5alloys have a dendritic structure. The dendrites consist of the BCC, FCC, and σ phases, and their interdendrites have a eutectic structure consisting of the BCC and ordered BCC phases. Al0·5CoCrFe2·0NiTi0.5alloy exhibits a three-phase eutectic structure consisting of the FCC, BCC, and ordered BCC phases. Fe is a stabilizer of the FCC phase and an inhibitor of σ phase formation in Al0·5CoCrFexNiTi0.5alloys. An increase in the Fe content decreases the hardness, σy, and σmaxbut increases the ductility. As the Fe molar ratio in the alloy increasing, the hardness, σy, and σmaxdecrease from HV730 to HV399, 1569 to 866MPa, and 2240–1736MPa, respectively, while εfincreases from 0.11 to 0.45. Al0·5CoCrNiFe1·5Ti0.5and Al0·5CoCrFe2·0NiTi0.5alloys exhibit high strength and good ductility and thus have promising use in future structural applications.",[],[]
