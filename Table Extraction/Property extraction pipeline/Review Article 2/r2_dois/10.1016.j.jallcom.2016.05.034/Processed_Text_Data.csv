0,Abstract,"AlCoCrFeNi alloy was prepared by arc melting and examined as-cast and after various heat treatments using XRD, SEM, micro-hardness and compression tests. It was found that the alloy solidified dendritically with an Al- and Ni-rich dendrite core and inter-dendritic regions rich in Co, Cr, and Fe. The dendrite core of the as-cast material presented a relatively soft matrix with nano-sized precipitates, while the inter-dendritic regions consisted of a relatively hard matrix with nano-sized particles larger than those in the dendrite core. Heat treatment did not change the dendritic morphology, however, different phase transformations occurred, especially in the inter-dendritic regions. Heat treatment between 650 and 975 °C caused transformation of the BCC matrix in the inter-dendritic regions to the σ phase, leading to a further increase in hardness. Heat treatment at 1100 °C caused transformation of the σ phase in the inter-dendritic matrix to a BCC structure and softening of the alloy. Heat treatment at 1200 °C caused partial phase dissolving and homogenization, which in turn enabled the alloy to re-enter the miscibility gap and decomposition to a BCC matrix, with B2 precipitation in the dendrite core and inter-dendritic regions. The impact of these changes on morphology and phase composition upon heat treatment in terms of mechanical behavior was discussed.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High entropy alloys (HEA) have drawn considerable interest from the materials community due to their industrial applications as tools, molds, dies, and mechanical and furnace parts[1–3]. These alloys are easily fabricated by using standard casting equipment, i.e. arc melting and induction melting furnaces, thus making mass production potentially easy[2]. These alloys usually comprise simple solid solutions (FCC, BCC and HCP) laid over more complex inter-metallic compounds, yielding alloys with high strengths[4–7], superior resistance to thermal softening[7–9], and outstanding resistance to wear[10–12]and corrosion[13,14].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"One of the most extensively investigated HEA is AlxCoCrCuFeNi[6,15–19], wherex(the atomic ratio in the alloy) ranges from 0 to 3. These alloys exhibit excellent elevated temperature strength and good wear resistance[6]. In general, the hardness of the FCC phase is between 1.0 and 2.0 GPa[6]. Alloys having a sole FCC phase present ductility between 20 and 60%, and usually exhibit significant work hardening[17]. With addition of aluminum (x = 0 to 3), the hardness of the alloys increases from 1.33 to 6.55 GPa[6], mainly due to the increased fraction of a strong BCC phase and strengthening of the BCC and FCC phases by the dissolved aluminum atoms. The precipitation of a nano-sized AlNi (B2) phase also leads to increased hardness values. However, these alloys become brittle and micro-cracking at the corners of the micro-hardness imprints was observed[6]. For alloys with relatively high Al content (x > 1), the micro-structure is composed of BCC matrix with B2 precipitates, with hardness values typically between 5.00 and 6.00 GPa, while the ductility decreases to less than 5%[17]. Furthermore, AlxCoCrCuFeNi alloys cannot be used at elevated temperatures due to Cu segregation in the inter-dendritic regions and grain boundaries, a scenario that is undesired as it compromises high temperature strength[2]. To overcome these drawbacks and to increase the softening resistance at high temperatures, Mo has been used instead of Cu, given its high melting point and elastic modulus[20,21]. Ti was added to improve the mechanical properties[22]. In other works, Ti[4,23]or Mn[9,24–26]replaced Cu.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Another manner to improve the high temperature mechanical properties of the alloy is by fabrication without Cu, as in the case of AlxCoCrFeNi[27–34], wherex(the atomic ratio in the alloy) ranges from 0 to 2. It was found[33,34]that the micro-structure and hardness of these alloys changed with increasing Al content in the alloy. For low Al concentration (x < 0.3), the micro-structure consisted of a soft FCC phase with hardness of about 1.0 GPa. Increasing the Al content between 0.3 and 0.9 caused the precipitation of a BCC phase along with the FCC structure. The fraction of the BCC phase increased with the Al alloy content, while hardness increased monotonically to 4.5 GPa. For Al concentrations above 0.9, only the hard BCC phase was stable, with hardness reaching 5.0 GPa[33,34]. The increased hardness was partly attributed to the spinodal decomposition of the BCC solid solution and the precipitation of NiAl nano-particles[2].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Recently numerous studies were performed on the influence of thermo-mechanical processes such as heavily cold rolling followed by annealing[35,36], friction stir-processing[37], and different manufacture process such as laser fabrication[38]on the mechanical and properties and the microstructure of AlCoCrFeNi system. Molecular dynamic simulation[39]and numerical simulations[40].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"To close porosity in as-cast AlCoCrFeNi alloy, Tang et al.[41]performed hot isostatic pressing (HIP) for specimens at 1100 °C for 1 h at a pressure of 207 MPa. Following HIP, the AlCoCrFeNi samples were heated in argon to 1150 °C at 10 °C/min, held at 1150 °C for 50 h, and then cooled to T = 50 °C at 10 °C/min. Tensile tests were then performed at 700 °C for the as-cast and homogenized specimens. The ultimate tensile strength was virtually unaffected and was 396 MPa. However, homogenization produced a large increase in ductility from 1.0% in the as-cast condition to around 12% for the homogenized specimens. An interesting concept was introduced by Lu et al.[42], namely eutectic high-entropy alloys (EHEA), in which the micro-structure has an eutectic-like micro-structure composed of alternating soft FCC and hard BCC phases. They designed AlCoCrFeNi2.1(atomic portion) with an as-cast micro-structure comprising a fine lamellar FCC/B2 which showed an unprecedented combination of high tensile ductility and high fracture strength from room temperature up to 600 °C. The as-cast and heat-treated to 600 °C alloy had a σUTSof 944 and 806 MPa and, tensile elongations of 27 and 34%, respectively.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"A striking property of the AlxCoCrFeNi alloy with x = 1 is its high ultimate compression strength, along with high elongation. It was found (unpublished work) that AlxCoCrCuFeNi (x = 1) alloy displayed compressive yield strength and ultimate compression strength of about 1500 and 1750 MPa, respectively, with a compressive elongation of only 4%. The AlCoCrFeNi alloy of equimolar composition with the same compressive yield strength value had an ultimate compressive strength of about 2800 MPa and elongation above 20%[2,4,43]. Accordingly, it would be important to broaden the work of Wang et al.[43]and investigate the impact of different heat treatment on the mechanical properties of the alloy.",[],[]
1,Introduction,The goals of the present work were: i) to impose different heat treatments to the AlCoCrFeNi alloy and analyze their influences on the mechanical properties of the alloy and correlate these with micro-structure and. ii) to understand the impact of Cu extraction from AlCoCrFeNi alloy on the markedly increased compression contraction in AlCoCrFeNi.,[],[]
2.1,Experimental procedures.Arc melting,"AlCoCrFeNi (denoted as HE63) alloy with an equi-atomic nominal composition was prepared by non-consumable electrode arc melting under a Ti-gettered, high-purity argon atmosphere on a water-cooled copper hearth. Fifty g of raw materials with purities higher than 99.5% were melted for ∼30 s at least 5 times to ensure that all raw materials were well mixed in their liquid state. The casts were turned upside down between each melting to improve chemical homogeneity. The nominal and actual compositions of the AlCoCrFeNi alloys are summarized inTable 1. The actual compositions of the buttons were checked at least at 20 different places and locations and all fell within the measured compositions provided inTable 1. The dimensions of the button after melting were 37 mm diameter and maximum height 11 mm. After arc melting, the casts were cross-sectioned into 4 mm-wide strips. The middle of the 4 mm strips was sliced into rectangles with dimensions of 4 × 4 mm2cross-section and a height of 8–11 mm. Then, the heights of the rectangles were abraded from both sides to 6 mm. The rest of the pieces were used as specimens for micro-structure and micro-hardness measurements.",[],"['tbl1', 'tbl1']"
2.2,Experimental procedures.Heat treatments,"According to our experience with HEA alloy exhibiting formation of an σ phase at intermediate temperatures, BCC to σ transformation occurred at around 650 °C and transformation back to BCC occurred at around 950 °C. As XRD diffractograms until 600 °C were identical to the cast alloy, we, therefore, used the cast results to represent the alloy at temperatures lower than 600 °C. The 850 °C point was chosen as the middle temperature range for the existence of the σ phase[34]. As a residual σ phase still existed at 950 °C, we used 975 °C sample as representing the alloy after the σ was completely dissolved. The 1100 °C sample was chosen following Kao at al[32]. However, our results indicate that at 1100 °C, homogenization was not obtained and as such, we choose 1200 °C as the homogenization temperature. Nevertheless, when the heating was performed in air only, a minimal oxidation layer was observed above 1000 °C. Following Kao et al.[32]and according to our experience, 3 h was sufficient time for creating the majority of changes in the specimen.",[],[]
2.3,"Experimental procedures.Metallographic specimen preparation, SEM analysis and micro-hardness determination","The metallographic specimens were mounted in phenolic resin, abraded by SiC papers up to 4000 grit and polished on a Buehler Vibromet using 0.05 μm colloidal silica. Whereas etching was not generally needed to observe micro-structure, in the as-cast condition, the specimens were slightly etched with Aqua Regia etchant to expose macro-structure. Micro-structural examination was performed using a high-resolution scanning electron microscope (Micro FA SEM- Quanta 200) equipped with an EDAX energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) unit. The raw data were corrected with a ZAF computer program[44]with accuracy of ±0.4 at%. The same specimens were also used for Vickers micro-hardness tests. For micro-hardness measurements of the dendrite core and the inter-dendritic regions, a 100 g load was applied for 15 s[9]. At least five indentations in the same region were conducted and the average of these measurements is reported.",[],[]
2.4,Experimental procedures.X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis,"XRD patterns of polished and un-etched samples were recorded using a Rigaku RINT 2100 (Tokyo, Japan) diffractometer with Cu Kα radiation (λ = 0.15406 nm). Data were acquired from 20 to 100° 2θ with a step size of 0.02°.",[],[]
2.5,Experimental procedures.Compressive tests,"For compressive testing, the rectangular specimens dimensions were of 4 × 4 mm2cross section and 6 mm height. The long dimension was perpendicular to the bottom of the ingot. The samples were compressed using a strain rate of 5 × 10−3mm/s. At least three different specimens were tested.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.XRD results,"XRD patterns of AlCoCrFeNi alloy in the as-cast condition and after various heat treatments are presented inFig. 1a. The range between 40 and 49° is extended inFig 1b. The as-cast alloy consisted mainly of the BCC phase. Small peaks near 30 and 51° correspond to 001 and 111 reflections of the ordered B2 phase, respectively. No phase transformations occurred below 650° C. After heat treatment at 850° C, both FCC and σ phases appeared. The σ phase is hard and brittle[2,3]with a tetragonal structure consisting mostly of Cr and Fe, which disappeared above 975° C. Closer examination of the FCC peak at 43.5° indicated that it had shifted to lower angles. In contrast, the BCC peak at 44.5° up to a heating temperature of 1100 °C had shifted to lower angles but at 1200 °C, it had shifted back to its original angle. It was found that Al content in AlxCoCrFeNi (where x is the atomic ratio in the alloy) might change the lattice constant of the FCC and BCC phases[33,45]. Therefore, we attributed the changes in location of the FCC and BCC peaks to the impact of heat treatment on Al concentration in the phases. After heat treatment at 1200 °C, the FCC phase almost fully disappeared, such that the BCC phase become dominant, while peaks related to the ordered BCC phase B2 become very weak, yet could still be noted.","['fig1', 'fig1']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.XRD results,"Although FCC was not found in the as-cast condition, it might still be present, but would remain undetected if the phase had only several vol% and nano-sized dimensions, as is the case in our research[46]. However, after heat treatment, the volume fraction, as well as the size, increased and thus become XRD-detectable.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.XRD results,We can summarize the XRD results by the following scheme:BCC + B2–650 °C → B2+ FCC + σ–975 °C → BCC + B2+ FCC–1200 °C → BCC + B2+ FCC traces.,[],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Micro-structural examination,"A back-scattered electron image (BSI) illustrating the dendritic macro-structure of the as-cast AlCoCrFeNi alloy far from the chill is given inFig. 2. At the bottom of the cast, higher cooling rates usually lead the grains to be cellular (not shown in the figure), which turn into equiaxed grains far from the bottom. However, the micro-structure of both grain populations was similar.",['fig2'],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Micro-structural examination,"Examination of the BSI SEM image of the alloy in the as-cast condition (Fig. 2) indicated that the dendrite core (DC) regions were darker (lower average Z number) than were the inter-dendritic (ID) regions, due to differences in composition (Table 2). The differences in DC and ID region composition originated from the coring effect[47]. As solidification proceeds, the liquid and solid followed their respective liquidus and solidus surfaces. Once solidification had completed, the micro-structure consisted of Ni and Al-rich DC and Cr and Fe-rich ID regions[43]. The micro-structure ( Figs. 3 a and b) consisted of nano-scaled precipitations and modulated basket-weave morphology particles in the DC and ID regions, respectively. The micro-structure in the DC region was finer than that of the ID region. Similar results have been reported[33,34,43,48], with this unique micro-structure being attributed to spinodal decomposition. TEM analysis[41,48]confirmed that in both regions, the micro-structure consisted of a BCC matrix and B2 precipitate. As will be presented below (Table 5), the DC was softer, indicating the possibility of existing soft FCC being present in this zone. According to our ongoing investigations, the DC micro-structure consisted of a matrix with eutectic-like micro-structure (i.e., a mixture of FCC and B2) and BCC precipitates, while the ID micro-structure consisted of a BCC matrix and B2 precipitates. Evolution of the micro-structure after heat treatment is presented inFigs. 4 and 5for the DC and ID regions, respectively. After heat treatment in the 850–975 °C range, micro-structure coarsening took place in the DC regions (compare Figs. 4 a and b). Bright rectangular particles appeared after heating at 850 °C (Fig. 4a), which disappeared after heating at 975 °C. The faceted shape of the precipitates disappeared after heating at 1100 °C and fine black particles formed within the coarse gray precipitates (Fig 4c). A dramatic micro-structural changes occurred during treatment at 1200 °C. The large gray precipitates almost completely dissolved in the matrix at this temperature and a micro-structure with nano-sized precipitates formed (Fig. 4d) upon cooling. The morphology of these precipitates in the DC and ID regions are presented at higher magnification and resolution inFigs. 4e and 5e, respectively. As can be seen, the morphology of the precipitates is similar to those observed in the as-cast condition, indicating that the spinodal decomposition had taken place during quenching of the specimen from 1200 °C in water.","['fig2', 'fig3', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig5', 'fig4', 'fig5']","['tbl2', 'tbl5']"
3.2,Results and discussion.Micro-structural examination,"As the AlCoCrFeNi melt met the liquidus line, it began to solidify as a saturated solid solution, most probably as BCC. Further cooling during solidification led the solid to enter the miscibility gap region (at around 1200° C) and decompose to BCC and nano-sized B2 precipitates. During heat treatment at 1200 °C, the alloy re-entered the solid solution region (from the opposite direction) and a saturated solid solution was obtained. Upon quenching the specimens to room temperature, the compound re-entered the miscibility gap and once again underwent a spinodal decomposition process. As the quenching to water process presents larger cooling rates, the B2 precipitates were smaller than those obtained during solidification (compareFig. 3a and b withFigs. 4e and 5e, respectively).","['fig3', 'fig4', 'fig5']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Micro-structural examination,"The micro-structure of the ID regions also changed as a function of heating temperature. Heat treatment in the 850–975 °C range led to micro-structure coarsening ( Figs. 5 a and 5b) and disappearance of the faceted nature of the precipitates. The micro-structure now comprised 3 phases reflected as dark (1, matrix), gray (2) and bright (3) in the figures. Further coarsening occurred after heat treatment at 1100 °C and small precipitates formed in the gray phases upon growth during treatment at 1200 °C. In addition, the bright phase disappeared and nano-sized bright precipitates appeared in the matrix, like those seen in the DC regions (Figs. 4e and 5e).","['fig5', 'fig4', 'fig5']",[]

Compositions (at. %) of the different phases in the ID regions after heat treatments of 1100 and 1200 °C are given inTable 4. The dark phase after heat treatments of 1100 and 1200 °C (points 1 and 4, respectively) are enriched with Al and Ni, while the bright (points 3 and 5) and gray (points 2 and 6) regions are enriched with Cr, Fe and Co. The bright regions are enriched with Fe and Co, as compared to the gray regions. Due to the relatively short heat treatments (3 h), the compositional changes occurred only at the micro-scale, while the average compositions of the DC and ID regions remained unchanged and were similar to those in the as-cast condition (Table 2).",[],"['tbl3', 'tbl4', 'tbl2']"
3.3.1,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties.Micro-hardness,"The results of micro-hardness measurements are summarized inTable 5. The micro-hardness of the DC remained the same after quenching from 1100 °C, yet increased after treatment at 1200 °C. The as-cast ID regions displayed higher micro-hardness values than those of the DC, which markedly increased after heat treatment at 850 °C and then decreased dramatically to values corresponding to the DC regions (4.5 GPa). Heat treatment at 1200 °C led to increased hardness values (up to 5.5 GPa), similar to those of DC region.",[],['tbl5']
3.3.1,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties.Micro-hardness,The fact that the micro-hardness of the DC regions remained almost constant (around 4.5 GPa) after heat treatment in the 850–1100 °C range (Table 5) indicated that no formation of new phases had taken place. Micro-hardness increases (up to 5.4 GPa) after heat treatment at 1200 °C was attributed to the precipitation of nano-sized particles (Fig. 4d) as a result of a spinodal decomposition of the super-saturated solid solution.,['fig4'],['tbl5']
3.3.1,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties.Micro-hardness,"The XRD results indicated the presence of a σ phase in specimens heat-treated at 850 °C (Fig. 1), when the hardness of the ID increased up to 6.0 GPa (Table 5). The micro-hardness increase in the ID regions but not in the DC regions was attributed as originating from the formation of the σ phase in the ID regions. Τhe σ phase is unstable at 975 °C[33,41]and transformed back to the BCC phase. Therefore, the ID hardness value decreased. After heat treatment at 1200 °C, nano-sized precipitates formed (Fig. 5d and e) which resulted in increased hardness of the DC and ID regions.","['fig1', 'fig5']",['tbl5']

TEM observation showed that the reason for this hardening phenomenon was not related to the presence of B2 precipitates but could be attributed to transformation of the BCC matrix to the very hard and brittle σ phase matrix[2,3]during aging. It was reported that the transformation temperature of the BCC to the σ phase in AlCrCoFeNi was about 600–700 °C[33,41].",[],[]

The σYand compressive strain, reflected in the difference between the yield compressive strength and the compressive ultimate tensile strength (UTS), were reduced markedly. After treatment at 975 °C, the brittleness decreased along with an increase in the yield strength, however, the strain decreased, relative to the as-cast specimens (Table 6). The observed changes in the mechanical properties were attributed to the presence of the σ phase in the micro-structure. A unique combination of the properties (high compressive yield and ultimate compressive strength, large uniform contraction and increased strain hardening) was achieved after treatment at 1100 and 1200 °C, when spinodal decomposition of the super-saturated solid solution took place during cooling and nano-sized precipitates formed.",['fig6'],"['tbl6', 'tbl6']"

They attributed these changes to the higher cooling rate obtained in the smaller cast diameter. Larger cooling rates resulted in finer micro-structures and hence, increased mechanical properties. Our cast button was about 11 mm in thickness and leading to similar results as those of Wang et al.[50]. The σUTSand εPreported inTable 7were higher than the values obtained in our study due to the higher cooling rates applied during solidification, and because of suction cast into a water-cooled copper mold with a 5 mm diameter versus an 11 mm diameter in our case.iii)Thermo-mechanical treatments",[],['tbl7']

On the other hand, heat treatment could change the phases present in the alloy, thereby compromising mechanical properties. For example, heat treatment of Al0·3CrFe1·5MnNi0.5in air for 3 h at 700 °C caused micro-hardness to increase from 6 GPa to more than 9 GPa due to phase transformation of the BCC matrix to the σ phase Hsieh et al.[51].

To improve further the mechanical properties, we are now investigating the impact of a higher homogenization temperature (1275 °C) followed by additional heat treatment to tailor the desired mechanical properties.

4,Summary,"The impact of heat treatment on AlCoCrFeNi alloy micro-structure and mechanical properties was investigated using SEM, XRD, compressive tests and Vickers micro-hardness measurements. The following results were obtained:1)The alloy solidified dendritically with DC regions presenting an average composition of 45.3 at.% Ni + Al and 54.7 at.% Co + Cr + Fe, while ID regions were enriched in Co, Cr and Fe (35.5 at.% Ni + Al and 64.5 at.% Co + Cr + Fe). The micro-structure of the DC regions consisted of a soft matrix (micro-hardness of 4.6 GPa), probably corresponding to an undetectable few vol% FCC structure with hard nano-sized precipitates, while the ID region consisted of a BCC matrix with hard nano-sized precipitates.2)Heat treatment at temperatures at 850 °C caused transformation of the BCC matrix into the brittle σ phase, with micro-hardness of the ID region increasing drastically. Heat treatment at 975 °C caused the σ phase to transform back to the BCC matrix, which caused alloy softening, resulting in decreased micro-hardness and increased elongation.3)During solid cooling after solidification or cooling after heat treatment between 1200 and 1100 °C, spinodal decomposition took place in both the DC and ID regions. In the DC regions, the super-saturated solid solution decomposed to a relatively soft matrix and small precipitations, while in the ID region, a hard BCC matrix and B2 precipitates formed. The combination of a relatively soft DC and hard and brittle ID regions provided a unique high compression strength combined with large contraction. The alloys with solely a BCC/B2 structure displayed high strength and low contraction.4)Cracks initiated and propagated in hard ID regions or near the interface of the DC and ID regions. Usually, these terminated when the crack tip reached the ductile DC region.5)The homogenization temperature for AlCoCrFeNi alloy should be above 1200 °C. At this temperature, the majority of the phases are dissolved. Upon cooling, the specimen re-enters the miscibility gap which is around 1200 °C and decomposes into two type precipitates. As a result, the compressive strength, as well as the compressive contraction, increased.",[],[]

The alloys with solely a BCC/B2 structure displayed high strength and low contraction.",[],[]
4,Summary,"Cracks initiated and propagated in hard ID regions or near the interface of the DC and ID regions. Usually, these terminated when the crack tip reached the ductile DC region.",[],[]
4,Summary,"The homogenization temperature for AlCoCrFeNi alloy should be above 1200 °C. At this temperature, the majority of the phases are dissolved. Upon cooling, the specimen re-enters the miscibility gap which is around 1200 °C and decomposes into two type precipitates. As a result, the compressive strength, as well as the compressive contraction, increased.",[],[]
