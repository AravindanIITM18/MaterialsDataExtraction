0,Abstract,"The AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) high entropy alloys were produced by vacuum arc melting. The crystal structure, microstructure, density and compression mechanical properties at 22°C–1000 °C of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys after homogenization annealing at 1200 °C for 24 h are reported. After homogenization the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys consist from single bcc solid solution phase, while the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys contain bcc phase and respectively 13% and 35% of hexagonal (C14) Laves phase. The density of alloys increases with increase of Cr content from 5590 kg m−3 of the AlNbTiV alloy to 5900 kg m−3 of the AlCr1.5NbTiV alloy. The strength of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys increases with increase of Cr concentration at temperatures from room to 800 °C. The yield strength of the AlNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys is 1000 MPa and 1700 MPa respectively at room temperature and 560 MPa and 970 MPa at 800 °C. Strengthening of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys with increase of Cr content is accompanied by decrease of ductility. Phase composition of the alloys was affected by deformation at 800 °C and 1000 °C. In the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys Nb2Al-type phase precipitated predominantly on grain boundaries, while in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys additional amounts of Laves phase appeared inside grains of bcc matrix. The experimentally observed phase composition of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys is compared with results of thermodynamical modeling of equilibrium phases in the alloys. The effect of phase composition of the alloys on mechanical properties is discussed and possibilities for properties optimization of the Al–Cr–Nb–Ti–V high entropy alloys are suggested.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The so-called high-entropy alloys (HEAs) – alloys, usually composed of at least 5 elements in approximately equimolar proportions[1]– have recently attracted considerable attention, mostly due to their exceptional mechanical properties[2]. One of the potential applications of HEAs is high temperatures materials[3]. For that purpose, HEAs based on refractory elements were introduced[4]. Some of high entropy alloys based on refractory elements have demonstrated remarkable high temperature strength, outperforming currently used nickel-based superalloys[4–12]. However, the first-developed alloys had disadvantage of high density of more than 10000 kg m−3. Lighter alloys of the Cr–Nb–Ti–V–Zr system with density of ≈6500 kg m−3and attractive mechanical properties were introduced[13,14]. Addition of Al also has been proved to have beneficial effect on density and strength of HEAs intended for high temperature application[15–21]. For example, the AlNbTiV alloy has low density of 5590 kg m−3, single bcc phase structure and yield strength of 1020 MPa and 685 MPa at room temperature and 800 °C, respectively[20]. However, further increase of strength of the alloy is desirable in order to be more competitive with currently-used nickel-based superalloys.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Intentional addition of second phase particles was recently suggested to be an effective strategy for development of HEAs for structural applications with desired properties[3]. Published data on structure of the Cr–Nb–Ti–V–Zr system alloys[13]suggests that addition of Cr to the AlNbTiV alloy can result in formation of Laves phase particles. Laves phase has been demonstrated to have beneficial effect on elevated temperature mechanical properties of the Cr–Nb–Ti–V–Zr system alloys[14]. Moreover, Cr content in hypothetical AlCrxNbTiV alloys supposedly can control volume fraction of Laves phase. It can be suggested that mechanical properties of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys would be largely determined by volume fraction of Laves phase. For example, direct correlation between volume fractions of respective B2 phase and σ-phase and strength was found in AlxCoCrFeNiMn and CoCrFeNiMnVxalloys[22,23]. However, experimental studies are required to prove these suggestions.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In most cases, the volume fraction of second phase(s) will be dependent not only on chemical composition of the alloy, but also on temperature. The temperature dependence of phase composition may result in structure instability at elevated temperature and provide the possibility to control second phase precipitates via annealing treatment[24]. In conventional alloys phase diagrams are used to predict stable phases at given temperatures. However, the experimental data on phase diagrams of compositionally complex HEAs is extremely limited[25,26]. Application of thermodynamic modeling can provide useful results[13,27–29], but does not always results in accurate predictions of phase transformations in HEAs[30]. Comparison between the experimentally observed phases in the promising alloys with predicted ones is required to establish the validity of thermodynamic modeling results.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Therefore, the aim of current work can be summarize as following: (i) to examine structure of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys and establish dependence of phase composition on Cr content; (ii) to study high temperature mechanical behavior of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys and to analyze effect of phase composition on strength of the alloys; (iii) to compare phase structure of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys with thermodynamic modeling predictions; (iv) to compare specific properties of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys with other high-temperature materials.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The alloys with nominal composition of Al25Nb25Ti25V25(subscripts indicate at.-% of corresponding elements, all the compositions given in text will be in at.-%), Al22Cr12Nb22Ti22V22, Al20Cr20Nb20Ti20V20and Al18Cr28Nb18Ti18V18, further denoted as AlNbTiV, AlCr0.5NbTiV, AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV, were produced by arc melting of the elements in a low-pressure, high-purity argon atmosphere inside a water-cooled copper cavity. The purities of the alloying elements were above 99.9%. To ensure chemical homogeneity, the ingots were flipped over and re-melted at least 5 times. The produced ingots of the alloys had dimensions of about 6 × 12 × 40 mm3. The cast ingots of the alloys were homogenized at 1200 °C for 24 h, in accord with regime used previously for the AlNbTiV and CrNbTiVZr alloys[13,20]. Prior to homogenization, the samples were sealed in vacuumed (10−2torr) quartz tubes filled with titanium chips to prevent oxidation. After annealing, the tubes with the samples were removed from the furnace and were cooled down to room temperature due to heat exchange with surrounding air. No signs of oxidation were observed after annealing.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Density of the homogenized alloys was measured hydrostatic weighting method. Density was measured on compressive specimens (see below), 3 samples of each alloy were measured. Compressive tests were performed on rectangular specimens with dimensions of 6 × 4 × 4 mm3using the Instron 300LX machine equipped with radial heating furnace. The compressive specimens were cut from homogenized ingots and carefully polished prior to testing. The specimens for testing were mechanically polished up to 4000 grit and then polished with OP-S suspension. Testing was carried out at temperatures of 22 °C, 600 °C, 800 °C and 1000 °C. For high temperature testing, specimens were put in preheated furnace, which was kept at desired temperature for ≈1 h, and held for 10 min prior to testing to equilibrate the temperature. The temperature of the specimen was controlled by thermocouple attached to its side surface. The initial strain rate was 10−4s−1. Testing was carried out to fracture of the specimens or to 50% strain. After testing specimens were taken out from the furnace and cooled on air. Signs of oxidation were found only after testing at 1000 °C. Samples after 50% compression strain were cut in half and their structure was studied on plane parallel to compression axis.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Crystal structure and microstructure of the homogenized and deformed alloys were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) techniques on the carefully mechanically polished samples. The specimens for structural investigations were mechanically polished up to 4000 grit and then polished with OP-S suspension. The XRD analysis was performed using RIGAKU diffractometer and Cu Kα radiation. SEM investigations were performed utilizing Quanta 600 FEG and Quanta 200 3D microscopes equipped with back-scattered electron (BSE), energy-dispersive (EDS) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) detectors. The average grain size and dimensions of second phase particles were measured from SEM-BSE images using the linear intercept method with Digimizer Image Analysis Software. Volume fraction of different phases was also measured using the same software and binarization procedure. Chemical composition of the alloys was measured using SEM-EDS by scanning area of 2 × 2 mm2. 2–3 scans in different areas were performed. Chemical composition of different structural constituents of the alloys was measured by point SEM-EDS analysis. 5–10 points were analyzed for each constituent. EBSD maps of bcc phase were collected with step size of 0.2–0.5 μm. TSL OIM Analysis 5.2 software was used to produce EBSD inverse pole figure (IPF) maps. Points with confidence index (CI) below 0.05 were excluded from consideration. No clean-up procedure was used. The low-angle (<15°) and high-angle (≥15 °C) boundaries are shown as white and black lines respectively.",[],[]

3.1,"Results.Density and mechanical properties of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys","The experimentally determined density of the of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys after homogenization annealing is given inTable 1. The given values demonstrates that increase of Cr content results in gradual increase of density of the alloys from 5590 kg m−3of the AlNbTiV to 5900 kg m−3of the AlCr1.5NbTiV alloy. Using the rule of mixtures and densities of the constitutive elements, the densities of disordered solid solutions with composition of the studied alloys were calculated (Table 3) using the following formula:(1)ρmix=∑Aici/∑((Aici)/ρi);where Ai, ciand ρiare atomic weight, concentration and density of theielement. Good correlation between the experimentally determined and calculated values of the density is observed. Good correlation between rule of mixture predictions and experimental density has been already reported for HEAs having either single solid solution phase or multiple phases, including ordered or intermetallic ones[4,7,8,13,15,17,20,21].",[],"['tbl1', 'tbl3']"

Apparently, Cr content has pronounced effect on mechanical properties of the alloys. For example, at room temperature all alloys demonstrate high yield strength, but limited ductility. Increase of Cr content in the AlCrxNbTiV alloys gradually makes them stronger but less ductile: the AlNbTiV alloy has yield strength of 1000 MPa, peak stress of 1280 MPa and fracture strain of 5.2%, whereas corresponding values for the AlCr1.5NbTiV alloy are 1700 MPa, 1700 MPa and 0%.",['fig1'],['tbl2']
3.1,"Results.Density and mechanical properties of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys","Increase of the testing temperature to 600 °C results in decrease of strength and increase of ductility of the alloys. The yield strength of the AlNbTiV alloy decreases to 780 MPa, but the fracture strain increases to 12.5%, while the AlCr1.5NbTiV alloy has yield strength of 1370 MPa and fracture strain of 0.8%. At higher temperature of 800 °C, pronounced increase of ductility of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys was observed – they were compressed to 50% strain without fracture. The yield strength of the AlNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys decreases to 560 MPa and 970 MPa respectively. The respective peak stress values are 700 MPa and 1045 MPa. Unlike deformation at lower temperatures, at 800 °C the stress–strain curves demonstrate pronounced softening stage after reaching peak stress. After softening stage, the AlNbTiV, AlCr0.5NbTiV and AlCrNbTiV demonstrate some hardening, while flow stress of the AlCr1.5NbTiV alloy continues to decrease gradually. At 1000 °C the yield strength of the alloys decreases pronouncedly, to 110 MPa for the AlNbTiV alloy and to 75 MPa for the AlCr1.5NbTiV alloy. After yielding, prolonged steady state flow stage is observed in the stress–strain curves of the AlNbTiV alloy, while during compression of the AlCr0.5NbTiV, AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys softening stage is observed after stress reaches peak value. Softening is more pronounced in the AlCrNbTiV alloy. The reasons why the stress–strain curves of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys demonstrate pronounced softening stage during compression at 800 °C and 1000 °C are unclear at the moment and require further studies which are beyond the scope of current work. Also, the increase of stress after reaching 30–40% strain during testing at 800 °C and 1000 °C is likely associated with barreling of the specimens.",[],[]

The AlNbTiV alloy has single bcc phase structure in the as-homogenized state (Fig 2a), which agrees with the previously published data[20]. Only two strong diffraction peaks are observed, possibly due to strong crystallographic texture. The same bcc structure retains after compression testing at 800 °C and 1000 °C. After deformation more Bragg peaks from bcc lattice are visible, probably due to weakening of initial texture. The lattice parameter of the bcc phase is not significantly affected by deformation and equals to 0.3186 ± 0.0005 nm. In addition to the bcc lattice, tiny peaks from tetragonal Nb2Al-type phase are found after deformation. The lattice parameters of the Nb2Al phase are a = 1.005 ± 0.003 nm and c = 0.512 ± 0.006 nm. The diffraction patterns of the AlCr0.5NbTiV alloy (Fig. 2b) are very similar to those of the AlNbTiV alloy: single, strongly textured, bcc phase is observed in the homogenized condition. Number of distinguished diffraction peaks from the bcc phase increases after deformation. Probably, deformation twinning and/or dynamic recrystallization result in weakening of initial texture in the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys after deformation. The lattice parameter of the bcc phase of the AlCr0.5NbTiV alloy is 0.316 ± 0.005 nm. Nb2Al-type phase is also observed in the AlCr0.5NbTiV alloy after deformation.

The XRD patterns of the AlCr1.5NbTiV alloy (Fig. 2d) are similar to those observed for the AlCrNbTiV alloy, but the intensity of diffraction peaks from the Laves phase is significantly higher.

No signs of second phases are found. The chemical composition of the grains is close to the actual composition of the alloys (Table 3). Formation of light second phase particles in the AlCrNbTiV alloy with higher Cr content is observed (Fig. 3c). The particles can be identified as Laves phase. The light particles are located both along the grain boundaries as discrete network and within grains as parallelepiped particles with average transversal and longitudinal sizes in examined projection of ≈3.0 ± 1.1 μm and ≈8.0 ± 2.6 μm, respectively. Their volume fraction is 13 ± 2%. The light particles are enriched with Nb (25.5%) and Cr (34.5%), and depleted of Al (18.0%), Ti (9.4%) and V (12.6%) (Table 3). Chemical composition of the matrix grains is close to the composition of the alloy, although slightly lower Cr content and slightly higher Ti content in the grains in comparison with alloys' composition can be noted. The average size of matrix grains is ≈ 150 ± 20 μm. Microstructure of the AlCr1.5NbTiV alloy (Fig. 3d) resembles microstructure of the AlCrNbTiV alloy. Volume fraction of the light second phase particles increases to 35 ± 3%. The increase of the volume fraction of the second phase particles is mainly associated with particles located within grains and not with grain boundary particles. The shape of the second phase particles within matrix grains becomes closer to equiaxed, and their size increases: average transversal and longitudinal sizes are 7.0 ± 2.9 μm and 13.0 ± 3.9 μm. The light particles are enriched with Nb (24.4%) and Cr (36.8%), and depleted of Al (16.9%), Ti (10.3%) and V (11.6%) (Table 3). The composition of the matrix grains is reasonably close to the actual composition of the alloy, although they are depleted of Cr (20.4%). Their average size is about 150 ± 10 μm. Twice lower bcc grain size in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys in comparison with the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys can be the reason for weaker texture observed in the homogenized alloys (Fig. 2).","['fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3', 'fig2']","['tbl3', 'tbl3', 'tbl3', 'tbl3']"

The AlNbTiV alloy (Fig. 4a) nearly retains single-phase microstructure of the homogenized alloy (Fig. 3a). Inside grains thin lamellar structure is found, probably due to twinning or deformation banding. Higher magnification insert inFig. 4a demonstrates presence of extremely fine precipitations (their size cannot be adequately estimated from SEM images) on grain boundaries of bcc matrix. The thickness of precipitation-containing zones can be estimated as of ∼1 μm. Due to fine scale and limited volume fraction of precipitates, the SEM-based EDX analysis has not revealed noticeable difference in composition between the grains and precipitation-containing zones on the grain boundaries (Table 4). However, the XRD data (Fig. 3a) suggests that the fine precipitates are Nb2Al-type phase particles. Additional transmission electron microscopy studies are required to precisely identify the fine precipitates in the AlNbTiV alloy (as well as precipitates in other alloys), but these studies are beyond the scope of current paper. The EBSD map of the AlNbTiV alloy (Fig. 4b) demonstrates that most of the lamellae inside bcc grains have high-angle boundaries. The misorientation of many boundaries is of ≈50°, which is close to misorientation of Ʃ11 twin boundaries (50.48°). Ʃ11 twins are found in plastically deformed bcc alloys[31], and twinning has already been reported to be an active deformation mechanism in a single bcc phase HfNbTaTiZr HEA[6].","['fig4', 'fig4', 'fig3', 'fig4', 'fig3', 'fig4']",['tbl4']

The volume fraction of the coarse Laves phase particles is 14 ± 1%. Formation of dark deformation bands can be observed in grains of bcc matrix. The deformation bands are often initiated at the light Laves particles. It seems that some of the Laves phase particles undergo fracture due to deformation. Also, precipitation of fine light particles from bcc matrix is observed. The size of precipitates is estimated of 0.2–0.5 μm. The precipitates are non-uniformly distributed and tend to appear on deformation bands. The volume fraction of the fine precipitates is 6 ± 2%. The chemical composition of the coarse Laves phase particles (Table 4) is close to the composition of Laves phase particles observed in the homogenized alloy (Table 3).

The equilibrium phases, their fraction and chemical composition at 600 °C, 800 °C, 1000 °C and 1200 °C are summarized inTable 6. The high-temperature parts of phase diagrams for all alloys look similar: below the melting point all alloys have single disordered bcc phase structure. The composition of the bcc phase is identical to the nominal composition of the alloys (Table 6). The solidification temperatures vary depending on alloys' composition. The predicted solidification temperature decreases with increase of the Cr concentration in the AlCrxNbTiV alloys. For example, the liquidus temperature is 1911 °C, 1796 °C, 1709 °C and 1655 °C respectively for the AlNbTiV, AlCr0.5NbTiV, AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys, whereas the respective solidus temperatures are 1880 °C, 1689 °C, 1613 °C and 1577 °C.

3.3,"Results.Thermodynamic predictions of equilibrium phase composition of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys","At lower temperature formation of intermetallic phases is predicted in all the AlCrxNbTiV alloys. The solvus temperature of intermetallic phases demonstrates non-uniform dependence on Cr content. For instance, in the AlNbTiV alloy Ti3Al phase appears at temperature of 770 °C (Fig. 6a). In the Cr-containing AlCr0.5NbTiV alloy Ti3Al and Laves phases are predicted. Hexagonal Laves phase appears first at 716 °C, whereas the Ti3Al phase forms at 680 °C (Fig. 6b). In the AlCrNbTiV alloy Laves phase with ordered fcc (C15) lattice appears at much higher temperature of 877 °C (Fig. 6c). When the temperature decreases further to 608 °C, small amount of Ti3Al phase appears. Finally, in the AlCr1.5NbTiV alloy only the C15 Laves phase appears at temperature of 1003 °C (Fig. 6d). In all the AlCrxNbTiV alloys the fraction of intermetallic phase(s) increases continuously with decrease of temperature below solvus temperature. In the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys fcc Laves phase undergoes transformation to hexagonal starting at temperatures of 682 °C and 617 °C, respectively.

4.1,"Discussion.Effect of Cr on structure of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys in as-homogenized condition and after deformation","The presented results demonstrate that Cr has pronounced effect on the initial (homogenized) structure of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys. Increase of Cr content results in formation of Laves phase particles in the bcc matrix phase. Typical deformation-induced microstructural features are observed in the AlCrxNbTiV alloys after compression at 800 °C and 1000 °C: compression of initial grains, deformation twinning (at 800 °C) and dynamic recrystallization (at 1000 °C), formation of deformation bands in the bcc matrix and fracture of the coarse Laves phase particles. Phase composition of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys is affected after high-temperature straining. Depending on Cr concentration and temperature, different secondary phases with different volume fraction appear. Thermodynamic modeling also predicts that equilibrium phase composition of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys is strongly dependent on Cr content. Let us compare the experimentally observed phase composition of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys after homogenization and high-temperature deformation with the predicted equilibrium phases.",[],[]
4.1,"Discussion.Effect of Cr on structure of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys in as-homogenized condition and after deformation","The phase composition of the homogenized AlCrxNbTiV alloys does not correspond to the predicted equilibrium phases at the homogenization temperature of 1200 °C. Single bcc phase structure is expected in the AlCrxNbTiV alloys in equilibrium at 1200 °C in accord with the thermodynamic predictions (Table 6), which contradicts presence of the Laves phase particles in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV. Probably, the cooling rate after homogenization (estimated as of ∼100 °C min−1) wasn't fast enough to prevent phase transformations occurring at lower temperatures. Comparison with the equilibrium phase diagrams of the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys (Fig. 6≿ and d) demonstrates that the fraction of Laves phase particles observed after homogenization corresponds to ≈795 °C and ≈775 °C, respectively. To round off, it can be accepted that equilibrium fraction of Laves phase after homogenization corresponds to ∼800 °C. At the temperatures of ∼800 °C in the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys single bcc solid solution phase is equilibrium (Fig. 6a and b), which agrees with the single phase structure observed in the homogenized alloys. Therefore, it can be assumed that during cooling after homogenization the diffusion freezes at temperature of ∼800 °C and the phase composition of the homogenized alloys corresponds to equilibrium at ∼800 °C.","['fig6', 'fig6']",['tbl6']
4.1,"Discussion.Effect of Cr on structure of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys in as-homogenized condition and after deformation","After deformation at 800 °C, fine submicron precipitates appear in the AlCrxNbTiV alloys. These precipitates are non-uniformly distributed – the precipitation-containing zones are located on the bcc matrix grain boundaries in the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys and predominantly on the deformation bands in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys. Precipitation of aluminides in the homogenized AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys and additional Laves phase in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys are predicted by equilibrium phase diagrams at temperatures lower than ≈700 °C (Fig. 6). It should be noted that in the AlCr0.5NbTiV alloy presence of both aluminide and Laves phases with similar volume fractions in equilibrium condition is anticipated, while presence of only aluminide phase is detected by XRD (Fig. 2b). Precipitation of the secondary phase only at specific preferred sites (grain boundaries and deformation bands) might indicate that the thermodynamic driving force at 800 °C or during cooling from this temperature is insufficient to cause phase transformations and additional conditions like high stresses on grain boundaries or high dislocations density in deformation bands are required. The sluggish diffusion kinetics is discussed as a specific feature of HEAs[2]and was recently verified experimentally in the CoCrFeNi0.5Mn alloy[34]. Sluggish diffusion at 800 °C and/or cooling from 800 °C can slow down phase transformations and result in non-equilibrium phase composition of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys after compression at 800 °C. The indirect confirmation of slow diffusion can be found in the almost identical chemical composition of the precipitation-containing zones and precipitation-free bcc matrix in the AlCrxNbTiV alloys (Table 4). Chemical composition of the second-phase precipitates is distinctively different from the surrounding bcc phase which is mirrored in different contrast in SEM-BSE images (Fig. 4). Therefore, the same chemical composition of precipitation-containing zones and precipitation-free bcc matrix can be attributed to different chemical composition of bcc phase adjacent to precipitates and distant from precipitates. The difference in chemical composition of bcc phase illustrates that long-range diffusion in the AlCrxNbTiV alloys after compression at 800 °C is hindered and thus the phase composition of the deformed alloys does not reach equilibrium.","['fig6', 'fig2', 'fig4']",['tbl4']
4.1,"Discussion.Effect of Cr on structure of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys in as-homogenized condition and after deformation","Much more pronounced changes in phase composition of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys are observed after compression at 1000 °C. Additional fine Nb2Al-type (in the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys) and Laves (in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys) phase particles appear. In the AlCr0.5NbTiV alloy insignificant fraction of the presumably Laves phase is also found. Increase of the volume fraction of the second phases at lower temperatures (in comparison with equilibrium amount at ∼800 °C observed after homogenization) is anticipated in accord with thermodynamic modeling (Fig. 6). The observed volume fraction of the aluminide phase in the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys (2% and 6% respectively) corresponds to equilibrium amount at ≈650–750 °C (Fig. 6a and b). But, according to equilibrium phase diagrams (Fig. 6c and d), the experimental fraction of the Laves phase the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys (45% and 56% respectively) is not reached even at temperature of 500 °C. As the diffusion in the AlCrxNbTiV alloys was found to be hindered already after deformation at 800 °C and following cooling (previous paragraph), it seems doubtful that phase composition after deformation at 1000 °C can correspond to equilibrium phase composition at temperatures lower than 500 °C. Probably, the exact fractions of the Laves and aluminide phases at temperatures lower than 800 °C temperatures can be incorrectly predicted by thermodynamic modeling due to limitations of existent databases[13,30]. Therefore additional experimental work is required to experimentally establish the characteristic phase transformation temperatures and the temperature dependence of the equilibrium phases' volume fractions in the AlxCrNbTiV alloys.","['fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6']",[]
4.1,"Discussion.Effect of Cr on structure of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys in as-homogenized condition and after deformation","The reason for the possible inaccurate prediction of fraction of intermetallic phases in the AlxCrNbTiV alloys can be due to wrong assessment of their crystal structure and chemical composition. The predicted equilibrium Laves phase in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys at temperatures of more than ≈700 °C has the cubic C15 lattice, and transition to equilibrium hexagonal phase is anticipated at lower temperature. The XRD reveals presence of hexagonal C14 Laves phase in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys both in homogenized state and after high-temperature deformation (Fig. 2c and d). It should be noted that the volume fraction of Laves phase in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys after homogenization corresponds to ≈800 °C, i.e. the cubic Laves phase is expected to stable at this temperature. Therefore it can be supposed that transformation of Laves phase from cubic to hexagonal occurs at higher temperatures than it is predicted. Comparison between the CrNbTiZr and CrNbTiVZr alloys containing C15 Laves phase[13]and the AlCrxNbTiV (present study) or AlxNbTiVZr[17]alloys suggests that Al can stabilize C14 Laves phase in the Al–Cr–Nb–Ti–V–Zr system HEAs. The chemical composition of the Laves phases in the homogenized condition of the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys also does not correspond to the predicted one. According to the thermodynamic model, the Laves phase (without regard to its crystal lattice) is expected to be enriched with Cr and Ti. However, in the homogenized condition the Laves phase particles are enriched with Cr (34.5–36.8%) and Nb (24.4–25.5%). The composition of binary Laves phase is described with the formula AB2, where the A element has higher atomic size than the B element. Apparently, in the Al–Cr–Nb–Ti–V system, Cr and Nb are respectively the smallest (130 pm)[3]and largest (150 pm) atoms. Therefore, Cr atoms are expected to take B sites in the ordered hexagonal C14 lattice, and Nb atoms take A sites. The predominant segregation of Cr and Nb to Laves phase reduces atomic distortions caused by atomic size difference in the bcc solid solution phase[23]. The Laves phase particles also contain Al (16.9–18.0%), Ti (9.4–10.3%) and V (11.6–12.6). The Ti atoms are the second largest (142 pm), the Al atoms are slightly smaller (141 pm), while the V atoms have small atoms (134 pm). Chemical composition of the Laves phase suggests that Al and V atoms take B sites, while Ti takes A sites. In this case, the composition of Laves phase can be described as (Nb, Ti) (Al, Cr, V)2.",['fig2'],[]
4.1,"Discussion.Effect of Cr on structure of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys in as-homogenized condition and after deformation","In the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys equilibrium phase diagrams predict existence of Ti3Al-type phase, whereas after compression at 800 °C and 1000 °C XRD detects peaks from Nb2Al-type phase (Fig. 2a and b) and no signs of Ti3Al phase can be found by XRD and SEM analysis. The concentration of Ti in the aluminide phase is ≈ 2 times lower than of Nb: in the AlCr0.5NbTiV alloy after compression at 1000 °C, the Nb2Al-type phase contains 39.0% of Nb and 18.5% of Ti (Table 5). The preferred segregation of Nb to aluminide phase instead of Ti is surprising due to higher mixing enthalpy in the corresponding atomic pairs with Al: ΔHmixAlNb= −18 kJ/mol while ΔHmixAlTi= −30 kJ/mol[35]. But the respective experimentally measured enthalpy of formation values, −25 kJ/mol for Nb2Al[36]and −25.3 kJ/mol for Ti3Al[37], suggest that formation of both aluminides is nearly equivalent in thermodynamic terms. Complex chemical composition of the observed Nb2Al-type phase can potentially lower the formation enthalpy value, and make it thermodynamically more preferable than Ti3Al phase. It should be noted that the formation enthalpy values reported in literature for the Ti3Al phase are rather diverse[38]. Probably, inaccurate assessment of formation enthalpy of Ti3Al phase during thermodynamic modeling can be the reason why instead of predicted Ti3Al-type phase Nb2Al-type particles is found in the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys.",['fig2'],['tbl5']

However, both modeling and experimental data agree that volume fraction of intermetallic (Laves) phases is dependent not only on Cr content in the AlCrxNbTiV alloys, but also is strongly temperature dependent (13% of Laves phase observed in the homogenized AlCrNbTiV alloy and 45% of Laves phase found in the same alloy after compression at 1000 °C). Together with Laves phase solvus temperature being much lower than the solidus temperature even in high-Cr alloys, this makes development of thermal or thermomechanical treatment of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys to obtain required volume fraction and (probably) control morphology and sizes of Laves phase particles possible.",[],[]
4.2,"Discussion.Structure-properties relationships in the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys","The presented results clearly demonstrate that alloying with Cr has significant effect on mechanical behavior of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys. The alloys become stronger with increase of Cr content. Apparently, the strengthening effect of Cr can be attributed to two factors: (i) solid solution strengthening; (ii) second (Laves) phase strengthening. The solid solution strengthening of the bcc matrix phase by Cr atoms can be anticipated due to much smaller atomic radius of Cr in comparison with atomic radii of other constitutive elements of the alloys causing significant lattice distortion[39,40]. The solid solution strengthening effect can be demonstrated by comparing mechanical properties of the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys. Both alloys prior to deformation have similar single-phase bcc structure with grain size of ∼300 μm, but the bcc matrix of the AlCr0.5NbTiV alloy contains ≈10% of Cr (Fig. 3a and b,Table 3). At room temperature the yield strength of the Cr-containing alloy is 30% higher than strength of the AlNbTiV alloy: the respective σYSvalues are 1300 MPa and 1000 MPa (Table 2). Almost the same difference, 29% (1010 MPa and 780 MPa), is observed at 600 °C. At 800 °C the difference between yield strength values decreases to 14% (640 MPa and 560 MPa). Solid solution strengthening effect is expected to decline with increase of temperature[39], and therefore closer yield strength values of the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys are anticipated. However, at 1000 °C the AlNbTiV alloy has the highest strength among the studied AlCrxNbTiV alloys - σYS= 110 MPa, while the other alloys have σYS= 40–75 MPa (Table 2). The reasons why the AlNbTiV becomes stronger than the Cr-containing AlCrxNbTiV alloys at 1000 °C, while it was softer than the other alloys at lower temperatures, are unclear. Supposedly, new strengthening mechanism(s) start to operate at 1000 °C in the AlNbTiV alloy, for example, strengthening due to precipitation of nano-scale second phases. Additional experimental work is required to explain superior strength of the AlNbTiV alloy at 1000 °C.",['fig3'],"['tbl3', 'tbl2', 'tbl2']"

Partially, increase of yield strength of the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys can be attributed to increase of Cr content in the bcc matrix and finer bcc grain size in comparison with the AlCr0.5NbTiV alloy. But difference between the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys having, for example, σYS= 1550 MPa and σYS= 1700 MPa respectively at room temperature, and σYS= 1050 MPa and σYS= 1370 MPa at 600 °C (Table 2), cannot be attributed to solid solution strengthening effect as the Cr content in both alloys is rather similar – 17.6% and 20.4%, respectively (Table 3), or the grain size as it is identical in both alloys. Therefore, it is expected that Laves phase particles contribute to increase of yield strength. Strong strengthening by Laves phase particles can be anticipated from data on Cr–Nb–Ti–V–Zr HEAs[14]. Due to relatively large scale of Laves phase particles and their significant volume fraction, the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys can be treated as natural composites. In this case, the strength of the whole alloy can be predicted from strength of constitutive phases and their volume fraction using the rule of mixtures.

4.2,"Discussion.Structure-properties relationships in the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys","Using equation(2), the strength of the alloy depending on the volume fraction of constitutive phases can be predicted. However, the information on strength of constitutive phases is required. The yield strength of bcc phase, σbcc, can be roughly estimated from the yield strength values of the single phase AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys. But there is no data on mechanical properties of the Laves phase with composition close to the observed in the studied alloys AlCrxNbTiV. Therefore, we have estimated the strength of the Laves phase found in the AlCrxNbTiV at various temperatures. For that purpose, we have used the experimentally obtained values of yield strength of the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys as σalloyvalues, the yield strength of the AlCr0.5NbTiV alloy as σbcc(Table 2), and the volume fraction of Laves phase particles observed in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys – 13% and 35% respectively. Potential increase of yield strength of bcc matrix due to increase of Cr concentration and increase of volume fraction of Laves phase during deformation were neglected. Rough estimation returned that σLaves≈ 3000 MPa at room temperature, σLaves≈ 2000 MPa at 600 °C and 800 °C, and σLaves≈ 100 MPa at 1000 °C. The high strength of Laves phase maintained at temperatures up to 800 °C should be the reason of high elevated temperature strength of the Laves-containing AlCrxNbTiV alloys. Equation(2)also can be used to predict performance of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys and optimize their chemical composition and structure. Using the obtained values of σLaves, it is possible to predict strength of alloys at different temperatures depending on volume fraction of Laves phase (which depends on Cr content and can be optimized by heat treatment). For example, hypothetical alloy containing 45% of Laves phase should have high yield strength of ≈2000 MPa at room temperature and ≈1350 MPa at 800 °C.","['fd2', 'fd2']",['tbl2']

It should be noted that the data for the Inconel 718 and TNM alloys was obtained in tension testing. Apparently the SYS of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys increases with Cr content at temperatures of ≤800 °C, and gradually decreases with increase of temperature from ambient to 800 °C. At 1000 °C pronounced drop of SYS is observed. The studied AlCrxNbTiV alloys are stronger than the Inconel 718 at temperatures ≤800 °C, and the SYS of the AlCr1.5NbTiV alloy is almost two times higher than strength of the Inconel 718 alloy at 22 °C and 800 °C.

The NbTiVZr alloy has nearly single bcc phase structure with insignificant fraction of second phase particles[13]. Comparison between the strength of the nearly single phase NbTiVZr, AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys demonstrates that the Al and Cr have more pronounced solid solution strengthening effect when they are added to the bcc solid solutions based on NbTiV, than Zr. However, the NbTiVZr alloy can be compressed to 50% strain without fracture at room temperature, while the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys have poor ductility at room temperatures and can be compressed to 50% strain without fracture only at 800 °C. Presumably, Al[43]and Cr in solid solution make the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys brittle at low temperatures. Coarse-grained structure of the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys could also limit their ductility, but good ductility of the NbTiVZr alloy with even higher grain size (300 μm and 600 μm[13]respectively) does not support this suggestion.",[],[]

However, the Laves-containing AlCrxNbTiV alloys, namely AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV, generally have higher SYS then the CrNbTiVZr alloy despite the fact that they contain only 13% and 35% of Laves phase, respectively. Higher strength of the Laves-containing alloys of the Al–Cr–Nb–Ti–V system in comparison with the alloys of the Cr–Nb–Ti–V–Zr system despite lower volume fraction of Laves phase can be attributed to (i) higher strength of the bcc phase due to alloying with Al (previous paragraph) and (ii) possibly higher strength of the Laves phase. The Laves phase of the alloys have different crystal structures: hexagonal C14 in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys and cubic C15 in the CrNbTiVZr alloy. Potentially, higher symmetry of the cubic lattice can make the plastic deformation easier[44]. Microstructural observation support this suggestion: the Laves phase particles in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys do not show any evidences of plastic deformation and instead often appear fractured, while in the CrNbTiZr and CrNbTiVZr alloys recrystallization and deformation twinning of Laves phase is observed[14].",[],[]

The simulated phase diagrams (Fig. 6) suggest that the Laves phase in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV can be dissolved and precipitated in controlled manner, thus enabling optimization of their morphology and volume fraction. However, the results of both local chemical analysis and thermodynamic modeling demonstrate that while Cr tend to segregate in Laves phase, Al is found predominantly in bcc matrix phase (Tables 3–6). Although the Al provides significant strengthening, it also makes bcc phase brittle[20,43]. Heat treatment cannot solve this problem, therefore the chemical composition of the Al–Cr–Nb–Ti–V alloys has to be optimized, i.e. Al concentration has to be reduced, to provide optimum combination of strength and ductility.",['fig6'],"['tbl3', 'tbl4', 'tbl5', 'tbl6']"
5,Conclusions,"In this study, crystal structure, microstructure, density and compression mechanical properties at 22–1000 °C of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys after homogenization annealing at 1200 °C for 24 h were examined. Following conclusions were made:1)After homogenization at 1200 °C the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys are single-phase bcc solid solutions, while in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys respectively 13% and 35% of hexagonal C14 Laves phase are found in the bcc matrix. The Laves phase is enriched with Cr and Nb.2)The density of the AlCrxNbTiV alloys increases with increase of Cr concentration. The experimentally measured density of the AlNbTiV, AlCr0.5NbTiV, AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys is 5590 kg m−3, 5710 kg m−3, 5820 kg m−3and 5900 kg m−3, respectively.3)The AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys demonstrate high compression strength at temperatures up to 800 °C. The strength increases with Cr content. For example, the compression yield strength of the AlNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys at room temperature is respectively 1000 MPa and 1700 °C, while at 800 °C the respective values are 560 MPa and 970 MPa. The specific yield strength of the AlCr1.5NbTiV at temperatures up to 800 °C was found to be superior to Cr–Nb–Ti–V–Zr system high entropy alloys, commercial nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718 and gamma-titanium aliminide based TNM alloy.4)The compression ductility of the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys decreases with increase of Cr content at room temperature and 600 °C. For example, at room temperature fracture strain of the AlNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys is 5.2% and 0%, respectively. At 600 °C, the respective values are 12.5% and 0.8%. At 800 °C and 1000 °C the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys can be compressed to 50% strain without fracture.5)After compression deformation at 800 °C and 1000 °C precipitation of second phases is observed in the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloy. In the AlNbTiV and AlCr0.5NbTiV alloys Nb2Al-type phase, enriched with Nb and Al, precipitate mostly on grain boundaries of bcc phase. In the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys hexagonal C14 Laves phase precipitates. The volume fraction and sizes of precipitated particles are higher after deformation at 1000 °C, probably due to hindered diffusion at 800 °C.6)Thermodynamic modeling of equilibrium phases in the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys demonstrated presence of single-phase bcc structure after solidification. At lower temperatures, formation of intermetallic phases is predicted: aluminide phase is expected in the AlNbTiV alloy, Laves phase in the AlCrNbTiV and AlCr1.5NbTiV alloys, and both aluminide and Laves phases in the AlCrNbTiV alloy. Comparison with experimental data demonstrates that thermodynamic modeling predicts correct trends, but does not provide accurate crystal structures, chemical compositions and volume fractions of phases in the AlCrxNbTiV (x = 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5) alloys.",[],[]
