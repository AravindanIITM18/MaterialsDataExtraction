0,Abstract,"The crystal structure, microstructure, and mechanical properties of HfMoxNbTaTiZr (x≤1) alloys were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and compression testing. All the as-solidified HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys possess a simple body-centered cubic structure. Lattice parameters of the HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys decrease with an increase in Mo concentration, but the corresponding densities show an opposite trend. The yield strength of the HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys increases from 1015MPa to 1512MPa as x increases from 0 to 1. The solid solution strengthening is linearly proportional to a Mo concentration suggesting that the strengthening effect from each Mo atom is additive. Except for the HfMoNbTaTiZr alloy, HfMoxNbTaTiZr (x<1) alloys exhibit excellent room-temperature plasticity (>50%). The material with x=0.75 is a new ductile refractory high-entropy alloy with promising mechanical properties.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"There are several ways to strengthen materials including strain hardening, solid-solution strengthening, precipitation hardening, etc.[1]. Solid-solution strengthening plays an important role for high-entropy alloys (HEAs)[2–4]and especially for refractory HEAs with a body-centered cubic (BCC) structure. Refractory HEAs exhibit encouraging mechanical properties and can be potentially used in extremely high temperature applications[5–11]. For example, a BCC HfNbTaTiZr alloy possesses an excellent combination of high yield strength (σ=929MPa) and plasticity (ε>50%)[7]. After an addition of a high-modulus refractory Mo element, the compression yield strength of an equiatomic HfMoNbTaTiZr alloy becomes equal to 556MPa at 1200°C, which is very high for superalloys[11]. However, its fracture strain value equal to 12% is not safe enough due to unavoidable impact loading of mechanical parts during dynamic operations. In this study, the effect of Mo addition on the strength and ductility of HfMoxNbTaTiZr (x≤1) alloys is studied, and the appropriate amount of added Mo is determined. In addition, a proposed mechanism for the solid solution strengthening produced by Mo addition (from 0at% Mo at x=0 to 16.7at% Mo at x=1) is consistent with the relationship between a strengthening magnitude and a solute concentration[12–15].",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"HfMoxNbTaTiZr HEAs were prepared by vacuum arc melting in a water-cooled copper crucible under argon atmosphere. All raw elemental materials had purities higher than 99.9wt%. A melting procedure was repeated at least five times to improve the chemical homogeneity of alloys. Crystal structures were examined with an X-ray diffractometer (Shimadzu XRD-6000) operated at 30kV and 20mA with a scanning rate of 4°/min from 20° to 100°. The obtained cast ingots were cut and polished to be studied under a scanning electron microscope (SEM, JEOL JSM-5410). Chemical compositions of the resulted cast alloys were analyzed by SEM and energy dispersive spectrometry. Compression tests were conducted using cylindrical samples with diameters of 3mm and heights of 6mm by means of an Instron 4468 universal testing machine. The samples were tested at an initial stain rate of 10−3/s.",[],[]
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 1 shows the x-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-solidified HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys exhibiting a BCC structure. Table 1 lists the lattice constants, densities, and values of Vickers hardness of the same alloys. The lattice constant decreases with an increased Mo content due to a smaller value of the Mo lattice constant (aMo=3.147Å) than that of the base alloy (aHfNbTaTiZr=3.406Å). However, the alloy density exhibits an opposite trend due to the higher density of Mo (10.22g/cm3) than that of the base alloy (9.91g/cm3). The Vickers hardness parameter increases with an increased Mo content, resulting in a total 50% increase of the Mo-1 alloy (at x=1), which demonstrates that a large magnitude of the solid solution strengthening can be further enhanced for the base alloy by Mo addition (which will be later confirmed by the compression strength test results).",['f0005'],['t0005']
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 2 shows the SEM backscattered images of the HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys. All alloys show the typical dendritic structure. Consistent with the XRD results, the obtained SEM data indicate no formation of other phases. The chemical compositions of dendrite and interdendrite regions in the HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys are listed in Table 2 . The dendrite region is rich in the elements with higher melting points (Ta, Mo, and Nb). Increased proportion of Mo segregates to the dendrite in the alloy with higher Mo content, which further causes larger image contrast due to the average atomic number effect on brightness. In contrast, the interdendrite region is rich in the elements with lower melting points (Hf, Ti, and Zr). The interdendrite region is still characterized by a BCC structure, although the overall content of its three constituents with a hexagonal closed packed structure amounts up to 65at% in the equiatomic HfMoNbTaTiZr alloy. This observation can be explained by a tendency of these three elements to form a BCC structure above the allotropic transition temperature, which means that the difference in free energy between the HCP and BCC structures is not large for these HCP elements as compared with that for Mo, Nb, and Ta.",['f0010'],['t0010']
3,Results and discussion," Fig. 3(a)  shows the compression stress-strain curves of the HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys. The obtained values of yield strength, fracture strain, and Young's modulus are listed in Table 3 . It shows that the yield strength and Young's modulus values increase with an increased Mo content, and the obtained HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys (except for the Mo-1 alloy) have excellent compression plasticity, indicating no evidence of fracture at a compression strain of 50%. The material with x=0.75 is a new ductile refractory high-entropy alloy with promising mechanical properties.",['f0015'],['t0015']
3,Results and discussion,"Solid solution strengthening originates from several kinds of interactions between dislocations and solute atoms including elastic interaction (size effect), modulus interaction, chemical interaction, electrical interaction, and local order interaction. The elastic and modulus interactions dominate the solid solution strengthening[12]. For binary alloys, the yield strength increment (Δσ) of substitutional solid solution strengthening can be defined as(1)Δσ=γGcn(MPa)whereγis the proportionality constant,Gis the shear modulus, andcis the solute concentration. The value ofn=1/2 is observed for a number of conventional alloys. However, for some materialsnis less than 1/2 (but is normally higher than 1/3), whereas for others n is greater than 1/2 (but is normally less than unity)[12].",[],[]
3,Results and discussion,"If the Mo atoms are considered as solute atoms, and the rest of the HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloy as a solvent matrix, the HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys could be then regarded as quasi-binary alloys (HfNbTaTiZr)-Mox. The differences in lattice parameter (aMo=3.147Å; aHfNbTaTiZr=3.406Å from Table 1 ) and modulus (EMo=329GPa; EHfNbTaTiZr=85GPa from Table 3 ) between the Mo solute atoms and the HfNbTaTiZr matrix alloy cause the solid solution strengthening as suggested by a conventional solution strengthening mechanism. The modulus interactions are believed to be particularly important since the Young's modulus of Mo is more than three times greater than that of the HfNbTaTiZr alloy. The yield strength increase of the HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys as a function of Mo concentration is illustrated in Fig. 3(b)  indicating a linear dependence between these two parameters. The obtained correlation between the yield strength increase and Mo concentration can be expressed as(2)Δσ=2921c(MPa)",['f0015'],"['t0005', 't0015']"
3,Results and discussion,"The resulting relationship does not match the c1/2dependence of the solid solution strengthening for conventional binary alloys. Fig. 3(b)  also shows the yield strength increase of AlxHfNbTaTiZr[16]and MoxNbTiVZr[9]HEAs as a function of Al and Mo concentrations, respectively. The MoxNbTiVZr alloys have a single solid solution phase at low Mo concentrations (x≤20at%). However, the alloy system undergoes a phase transformation and becomes two phases at high Mo concentrations (x>20at%). In order to avoid the second phase strengthening effect, only the data points corresponding to low Mo concentrations were plotted. It should be noted that the data of the AlxHfNbTaTiZr and MoxNbTiVZr alloys are also characterized by a linear correlation between the yield strength and solute concentration. This demonstrates that the strengthening of each solute atom in a high-entropy alloy matrix is additive.",['f0015'],[]
4,Conclusions,"HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys (x≤1) have a simple BCC structure. The lattice parameters of these alloys decrease with an increase in Mo concentration, but their densities show an opposite trend. The microstructures of all studied alloys correspond to a typical dendritic structure. No other phases were formed in the interdendrite region. The yield strength of the studied alloys increases from 1015MPa to 1512MPa with an increase in Mo concentration from zero to 16.7at% indicating a significant solid solution strengthening in the HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys due to Mo addition. The obtained HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys show excellent room-temperature plasticity. The studied alloys, except for the Mo-1 alloy, underwent a 50% compression strain without any evidence of fracture. The HfMoxNbTaTiZr alloys can be considered as quasi-binary alloys, and a linear correlation between their yield strength and a solute atom concentration is established.",[],[]
