0,Abstract,"Texture evolution during room-temperature tensile testing of recrystallized equimolar CrCoNi was studied using electron backscatter diffraction and electron channeling contrast imaging on specimens from interrupted tests. Dominant deformation mechanisms included slip at low strains and deformation twinning at larger strains, which were accompanied by the development of a strong <111> texture parallel to the tensile axis. Highly deformed material also contained nanotwin/hcp lamellae, which have previously been hypothesized to act as potent barriers for non-coplanar dislocations. To examine this hypothesis, mean-field modeling was performed using the viscoplastic self-consistent framework with varying ratios for hardening by slip and twinning. In the optimal model, twinning produced approximately three times as much non-coplanar hardening as slip, which is larger than previous observations in other twinning-induced plasticity materials that do not form twin/hcp lamellae. Additional full-field elasto-viscoplastic simulations were performed using the fast Fourier transform (EVP-FFT) method to examine intragranular rotation and the effect of initial grain orientation on the deformation mode. Grains with initial orientations near <111> had the greatest propensity for deformation twinning while grains near <100> were more likely to deform by slip even at large strains. Excellent quantitative agreement was obtained between the experiments and EVP-FFT model.",[],[]
1.1,Introduction.Deformation mechanisms and texture development,"Experimental work [11–13] and simulation [14–16] indicate that equiatomic CrCoNi and similar alloys like CrMnFeCoNi have low stacking fault energies, which are even predicted by simulation to be negative at 0 K [17]. This enables dislocation dissociation and deformation twinning when the stress exceeds a material-dependent threshold [11,18]. It is widely accepted that deformation twinning enables the high hardening rates and large tensile extensions in TWIP steels [19,20] and a similar role has been ascribed to it in CrMnFeCoNi [1,11] and CrCoNi [21]. Additionally, Miao et al. [21] and Niu et al. [17] recently reported further enhancement of hardening rates in CrCoNi via local transformations from the face-centered cubic (fcc) phase to the hexagonal close-packed (hcp) phase that occur along stacking faults and deformation twins. Unlike the more conventional transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) effect, which relies on large-scale phase changes, the hardening behavior in CrCoNi occurs despite very small transformed volumes of material with most hcp regions showing thicknesses on the order of several atomic layers. Very similar transformations have been observed during uniaxial tensile testing in FeCoCrNi [10] and during high-pressure diamond anvil cell experiments with CrMnFeCoNi [22]. These types of metastable alloys have been generally linked to outstanding combinations of strength and ductility [9,17].",[],[]
1.1,Introduction.Deformation mechanisms and texture development,"Although the nanoscale deformation mechanisms of CrCoNi have recently been explored, little work has been done to connect these with texture development and mechanical behavior at coarser length scales. Joo et al. reported the development of a strong <111> and <100> double-fiber texture in CrMnFeCoNi after imparting large strains in uniaxial tension [23], which is consistent with observations in other fcc materials with low stacking fault energies [24]. The same double-fiber texture has also been reported in TWIP steels [25,26]. Although these results have been qualitatively described, quantitative comparison of texture across these alloys has been very limited.",[],[]
1.2,Introduction.Modeling frameworks for mechanical response and texture development,"Modeling efforts have been very limited for HEAs. Although a homogenized constitutive theory based on Kocks-Mecking was recently presented for CrMnFeCoNi [27], no modeling efforts have been described for the stronger ternary alloy CrCoNi. In contrast, several studies have attempted to capture the mechanical response and texture development in mechanically-similar TWIP steels using a variety of techniques. For example, one common approach invokes the mean-field visco-plastic self-consistent (VPSC) framework developed by Lebensohn et al., which treats individual grains as inclusions in a uniform medium with the average properties of the polycrystal [28,29]. Several studies including those of De Cooman et al. [30] and Saleh et al. [31] successfully employed the VPSC method to capture qualitative aspects of the experimentally observed <111> and <100> double-fiber texture in TWIP steels; however, quantitative agreement is presently lacking in literature.",[],[]
1.2,Introduction.Modeling frameworks for mechanical response and texture development,"Although the homogenized VPSC framework is useful in modeling overall stress-strain response and texture evolution, it is unable to provide spatially resolved predictions for either reorientation of individual grains or the localization of the mechanical fields within a polycrystal. One alternative that addresses this issue is the full-field elasto-viscoplastic formulation based on the fast Fourier transform (EVP-FFT), as reported by Lebensohn et al. [32]. This method is routinely used as a complimentary technique to crystal plasticity finite elements [33–35]. One key advantage of full-field modeling is that the simulation output can be directly compared to experimental observations by using electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) data as the simulation domain; in doing so, simulations can be performed on regions that have been observed experimentally.",[],[]
1.2,Introduction.Modeling frameworks for mechanical response and texture development,"In this work, experimental and modeling results are combined to connect deformation modes at the nanoscale (including deformation twinning) to the hardening behavior and texture development at larger length scales. Although qualitative texture development has previously been reported for CrMnFeCoNi, this is the first study to quantitatively examine texture in the stronger ternary subset CrCoNi (which exhibits the fcc-to-hcp transformation during room-temperature uniaxial tension, unlike CrMnFeCoNi [17]) and the first to apply the EVP-FFT framework to alloys with a high propensity for deformation twinning, including TWIP/TRIP steels and other high entropy alloys. To the authors' knowledge, this is also the first work to directly compare the VPSC and EVP-FFT frameworks using the same hardening parameters on the same experimental data. Modeling results successfully capture several key features of the deformed microstructure including bulk texture as a function of strain and the presence of large intragranular rotations. The ability of the EVP-FFT method to predict texture evolution and slip system activity in CrCoNi and other low-stacking fault energy alloys is also assessed.",[],[]
2.1,Experimental procedures.Material and processing,"Ingots of equiatomic CrCoNi were produced by arc melting pure (>99.9%) constituent metals under Ar atmosphere followed by drop-casting into a copper mold. Ingots were flipped and re-melted to ensure mixing and homogenized for 24 h at 1200 °C before cold-rolling to a reduction of approximately 70%. These processes are similar to those described in previous publications [21,36].",[],[]
2.2,Experimental procedures.Mechanical testing,"Rolled plates were cut by electrical discharge machining into flat tensile specimens with nominal gauge dimensions 5 mm (length) x 2 mm (width) x 1.2 mm (thickness) and grip widths of 3 mm. The longitudinal (tensile) axes of the specimens were aligned with the rolling direction of the original plate and the faces were parallel to the plate surface. Specimens were annealed for 1 h in air at 900 °C (1173 K) to produce a fully recrystallized microstructure. All faces of the gauge sections were mechanically polished using 400-, 600-, and 800-grit SiC paper to remove the heat treatment oxide layer and facilitate more accurate measurement before testing.",[],[]
2.2,Experimental procedures.Mechanical testing,"Uniaxial tensile testing was performed on an Instron Electrothermal Mechanical Tester (ETMT) with engineering strain rates of 5–10 · 10−4s−1. Strain measurements were made using digital image correlation (DIC) with paint patterns applied to the surface of the specimens. Full-field strain maps were produced with Correlated Solutions VIC2D software [37] using subset and step sizes of approximately 0.65 mm and 0.01 mm, respectively. Engineering strain was determined through conversion of the average Lagrangian strain in the gauge section as calculated by VIC2D. True stress and strain were calculated from engineering values assuming a constant volume during plastic deformation.",[],[]
2.2,Experimental procedures.Mechanical testing,"For interrupted testing, cross-head displacement was stopped at pre-determined load values corresponding to true strains of 5%, 8%, 11%, 14%, 20%, 30%, and 51%. During each interruption, the sample was unloaded and examined in the scanning electron microscope on the opposite face from the speckle pattern used for DIC. In this way, the original DIC pattern remained undisturbed and was used for each iteration of testing. The Lagrangian strain for each iteration was calculated in VIC2D as described above and converted to true (logarithmic) strain. These values were summed to determine the cumulative true strain, which was subsequently used to compute the corresponding true stress values. For comparison to uninterrupted tests, the elastic portion of each iteration was removed.",[],[]
2.3,Experimental procedures.Material characterization,"Pre- and post-deformation specimens were prepared for study by electron microscopy using a parallel polisher and 400-, 600-, 800-, and 1200-grit SiC papers. A final chemo-mechanical polish was performed using 50 nm colloidal silica. Specimen compositions were confirmed using semi-quantitative energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). Grain size was determined using the Heyn lineal intercept method as outlined in ASTME112with a total of 589 intercepts [38].",[],[]
2.3,Experimental procedures.Material characterization,"Specimens were examined using an FEI Apreo scanning electron microscope (SEM). Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was performed using an EDAX Hikari Super EBSD camera in conjunction with acquisition software EDAX TSL DC7 and analysis software EDAX TSL OIM 8 [39]. Scans were acquired using an accelerating voltage of 20 kV and a beam current of 6.4 nA at a working distance of 20 mm; the region used as input for the EVP-FFT model (described below) was 310 × 310 μm with a 500 nm step size. Higher resolution scans with step sizes of 30–100 nm were required to capture deformation twins. For the interrupted tensile test, no polishing was performed between iterations; however, pattern quality decreased markedly beyond strains of 20% due to substantial rotation of grains on the specimen surface and accumulated deformation in the microstructure. Accordingly, scanning after 51% true strain yielded few indexable points and the specimen was re-polished after the final test to better study the microstructure in the highly deformed state.",[],[]
2.3,Experimental procedures.Material characterization,"Deformation structures were studied by Electron Channeling Contrast Imaging (ECCI) (e.g, [8,40]) with an accelerating voltage of 30 kV and a beam current of 6.4 nA. Highly deformed samples were studied with smaller accelerating voltages and currents (down to 5 kV and 0.4 nA) to reduce the beam interaction volume and improve resolution at the sample surface. Images were always acquired in regions with corresponding EBSD data to enable slip trace analysis and calculation of the incident beam direction.",[],[]
2.3,Experimental procedures.Material characterization,High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) was used to examine deformation structures with greater resolution. TEM specimens were prepared using electropolishing in an electrolyte consisting of 20% perchloric acid in methanol at −30 °C and a voltage of 10–13 V. STEM characterization was conducted on a probe-corrected and monochromated Titan380-300™ microscope in high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) mode. Scanning distortion and noise in STEM images were further reduced via nonlinear drift distortion correction [41].,[],[]
2.4.1,Experimental procedures.Modeling framework.VPSC modeling,"For brevity, the discussion of the viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) framework is restricted to the single crystal material model with further details supplied in previous publications [28,42–44]. The VPSC model considers each grain as an ellipsoidal inclusion in a homogeneous medium which has the average properties of the polycrystal. Twinning was implemented as a pseudo-slip mechanism; in contrast to slip systems where shear can occur in both positive and negative directions, twinning shear can only occur in one direction. This is consistent with the unidirectionality of twinning shear used in other works [45,46]. We considered 12 independent slip systems (24 considering bi-directionality) and 12 independent twinning systems for the fcc crystal system in the present work. The local constitutive law is described by a non-linear rate-sensitive equation:(1)ε˙d=∑1smsγs˙=γ0˙∑1sms(ms:σdτ0s)nsgn(ms:σd)whereγs˙is the shear rate,τ0sis the critical resolved shear stress (CRSS), andmsis the Schmid tensor. Variablesε˙dandσdare the deviatoric strain rate and stress, respectively. In equation(1),γ0˙is a reference shear rate and n is the stress exponent (taken as n = 20 in this work). We assumed a Voce-type hardening law for the evolution of the critical resolved shear stress with the accumulated strain. The evolution equation reads as:(3)τcrs=τ0s+(τ1s+θ1sΓ)[1−exp(−θ0sΓτ1s)]whereΓ=∑sΔγsis the accumulated shear strain summing over all the slip and twinning systems,τ0sis the initial CRSS, and (τ0s+τ1s) is the back extrapolated CRSS. Variablesθ0sandθ1sare the initial hardening rate and the asymptotic hardening rate, respectively. Additionally, preferential hardening of the non-coplanar slip and twin systems can occur due to shear in any other slip or twin system [35,46,47]. This preferential hardening of the non-coplanar systems confines further slip or twinning in the coplanar systems. This phenomenon can be captured in the model by assuming a hardening matrixhss'which influences the evolution of the CRSS on a particular slip or twinning system in the following manner:(4)Δτs=dτcrsdΓ∑s'hss'Δγs'whereΔτsrepresents the change in CRSS of the systemsdue to shear on systems’ anddτcrsdΓis the derivative of equation(3). The diagonal terms in thehss'matrix (i.e. whens=s’) are called ‘self’ hardening and their values are kept as 1. The off-diagonal terms are known as ‘latent’ hardening and their values are dependent on whether they are related to coplanar or non-coplanar systems. The degree of latent hardening was varied to explore the effect on the texture evolution and predicted twin volume fraction. Non-coplanar latent hardening parameters were varied independently for slip and twinning deformation systems. An additional case was performed considering only slip without the possibility of deformation twinning.Table 1contains the complete list of hardening parameters used in this work with the model producing the best results indicated in bold. A detailed discussion on the choice of parameters is provided in the results.","['fd1', 'fd3']",['tbl1']
2.4.1,Experimental procedures.Modeling framework.VPSC modeling,"Grain orientations were selected directly from an EBSD orientation image containing approximately 600 grains with the weight fractions of the grains assumed to be same as the area fractions of the respective grains in the EBSD image. All simulations were done at a strain rate of 5.3*10−4s−1with a strain increment of 0.004. Although the predominant twin reorientation (PTR) scheme was used, a high threshold was established to restrict the reorientation effect and eliminate the effect of twinning on texture evolution [44].",[],[]
2.4.2,Experimental procedures.Modeling framework.EVP-FFT modeling,"Full-field simulations were performed using the EVP-FFT crystal plasticity framework proposed by Lebensohn et al. [32]. The single crystal constitutive model for EVP-FFT differs from VPSC in considering the full Cauchy stress tensor for the calculation of the strain rate. EVP-FFT uses an Euler implicit time discretization scheme and anisotropic elasticity for the time evolution of stress in a material pointx. The equation reads as(5)σt+Δt(x)=C(x)∶εe,t+Δt(x)=C(x)∶(εt+Δt(x)−εp,t(x)−ε′p,t+Δt(x,σt+Δt)Δt)whereσis the Cauchy stress tensor, C is the elastic stiffness tensor andεis the strain tensor. In a small strain approximationεcan be simply written as a sum of elastic and plastic components,ε=εe+εp. The plastic strain rateε′pis calculated using a single crystal constitutive model similar to equation(1); the only difference is that the full Cauchy stress tensor is used in the calculation for the EVP-FFT model. Simulations were conducted at a strain rate of 5.3*10−4s−1with a time step of 0.2s, which imposed a strain increment of ∼0.0001 in each step. The elastic stiffness tensor values were C11 = 249 GPa, C12 = 156 GPa and C44 = 142 GPa [48]. Voce hardening parameters were identical to those used for VPSC.",['fd1'],[]
2.4.2,Experimental procedures.Modeling framework.EVP-FFT modeling,"The representative volume element (RVE) was constructed directly using experimentally obtained EBSD data after the work of Lebensohn et al. [49]. The input region captured an area of 310 × 310 μm2which contained approximately 600 surface grains or ∼387,000 discretely sampled points. An EBSD image provides information from the surface layer of the material; to examine the influence of the free surface effect, both 2D (quasi 3D) and full 3D simulations were performed. The x- and y-directions were padded with random orientations to produce periodic boundary conditions required by the simulation. For the simpler 2D simulation, the z-direction contained only one layer with orientations from the scan. The single layer of interest from the experimental data therefore behaved like a columnar grain along the z-direction and the final RVE had 256 × 256 x 1 grid points. In the 3D simulation, the free surface was accounted for by using five layers of an infinitely compliant gas phase above the data from the EBSD image. The orientations from the experimental data were duplicated across six layers to create a columnar grain structure into the simulation volume. Five layers of random orientation were used below to satisfy the periodic boundary conditions for a final RVE with 256 × 256 x 16 grid points.",[],[]
2.4.2,Experimental procedures.Modeling framework.EVP-FFT modeling,All the simulated orientation images and inverse pole figure maps were plotted using the openly available software MTEX [50]. The volume fraction of texture components and the fibers for both the experimental and simulated data were also calculated with MTEX integrating the orientation distribution function for the individual components or fibers over a 15° region.,[],[]
3.1,Results.Microstructure and mechanical properties,"The initial microstructure of the as-annealed specimens is shown inFig. 1, which contains approximately 600 complete, non-edge grains. The specimen coordinate system for reference with IPF maps is given inFig. 1a. The material was fully recrystallized with a large fraction of annealing twins (approximately 30% by area inFig. 1) and a mean grain size of 24 μm when annealing twin boundaries were not counted as grain boundaries. Consistent with previous studies, SEM-EDS results did not indicate any elemental segregation or additional phase formation in the undeformed material.","['fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1']",[]
3.1,Results.Microstructure and mechanical properties,"The true stress-true strain curves inFig. 2show the cumulative true strain of the specimen both with interruptions (red) and with the elastic loading for each test removed (blue). When the elastic strains are eliminated, the curve aligns with that of an uninterrupted test (black), verifying that interrupted testing does not affect the progression of hardening behavior. The hardening rate dσ/dε is also shown from an uninterrupted test. The shape of the hardening curve is typical of CrCoNi and the five-component Cantor alloy (CrFeMnCoNi) with a very large initial hardening rate that decreases rapidly during the early stages of plastic deformation. The slope of the hardening curve changed markedly around 9.1% true strain (approximately 622 MPa true stress) and remained roughly constant, corresponding to a linearly decreasing hardening rate, for the duration of the test. The change in slope during the early stages of plastic deformation has been previously linked to the onset of deformation twinning in high entropy alloys [11] and TWIP steels [25].",['fig2'],[]
3.1,Results.Microstructure and mechanical properties,"The early stages of deformation were primarily accommodated by slip of perfect and partial dislocations.Fig. 3shows typical defects at 5% true strain with a horizontal specimen loading direction for the displayed images. At lower magnifications, pronounced slip traces were clearly visible on multiple {111} planes in each grain, as indicated inFig. 3a. Some intragranular misorientation was already apparent, particularly near boundaries and in regions with a high defect density. An example is indicated by arrow 1, which highlights intragranular changes in contrast caused by local rotation and changes to the surface orientation. Additionally, several annealing twin boundaries were present in the acquired region. These twins clearly act as potent barriers to dislocation motion on the preferred slip planes; for example, dislocation pile-ups are visible adjacent to twin boundaries on the left and right sides ofFig. 3a as indicated by arrows 2 and 3. Higher magnification inFig. 3b shows both isolated single dislocations and some partial dislocations separated by large, extended stacking faults that exhibit characteristic contrast fringes. The region from which these images were acquired is shown in the EBSD inverse pole figure map inFig. 3c, where the color of each grain indicates its orientation parallel to the tensile axis.","['fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3']",[]
3.1,Results.Microstructure and mechanical properties,"At larger strains, extensive deformation twinning was observed with confirmation from transmission electron microscopy diffraction patterns and EBSD.Fig. 4shows a region with a high density of deformation twins after testing to 51% true strain. InFig. 4a, which shows an EBSD inverse pole figure map, pink and red regions with a near-<001> orientation to the tensile axis are deformation twin bundles with the appropriate relationship to the near-<111> parent grain in blue. Examination of the inset region via ECCI inFig. 4b also clearly shows the presence of defect content (bright linear features) on the three labelled {111}-type planes, each of which corresponds to a set of deformation twins shown in the IPF map.","['fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4']",[]
3.1,Results.Microstructure and mechanical properties,"Although numerous deformation twins are visible inFig. 4b, many of them, especially on the (1¯11¯) plane, were unindexed in the corresponding EBSD map inFig. 4a even with step sizes of 30 nm, which is typically regarded as the approximate lateral spatial resolution of EBSD. These unindexed regions appeared as black lines on Image Quality (IQ) maps due to pattern convolution between the twin and parent grain, which may be further complicated by the presence of nanoscale hcp lamellae.","['fig4', 'fig4']",[]
3.1,Results.Microstructure and mechanical properties,"The nanotwin/hcp lamellae were directly observed using atomic resolution high-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM).Fig. 5a is a HAADF-STEM image along [101]fcc, showing a narrow deformation twin. To better visualize the deformation substructure, center of symmetry (COS) analysis [51] was utilized to analyze HAADF-STEM images. The COS map inFig. 5b shows three adjacent {111} planes as “hot” in the COS map, meaning that there is indeed a thin hcp layer that has formed on each twin-matrix interface, that can be recognized as local A-B-A stacking. This highly local transformation can occur with the passage of a single Shockley partial dislocation along the twin interfaces [17]. Repetition of this process on every other {111} plane can thicken the hcp layer. The HAADF-STEM image and corresponding COS map inFig. 5c–d shows the formation of four-layer hcp structure near a deformation twin. A well-developed nanotwin-hcp lamella is shown inFig. 5e–f. The morphology and thickness of these regions is typical with only small volumes undergoing the fcc to hcp transformation even in highly deformed specimens.","['fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5', 'fig5']",[]
3.1,Results.Microstructure and mechanical properties,"Fig. 6shows the evolution of the deformation substructure in a single grain starting from 5% true strain, where individual defects are visible as bright broken lines on well-defined slip planes (bright lines spanning the entire grain). At larger strains of 14% and 30%, after the onset of twinning, broken lines corresponding to separate defects are no longer visible and the defect density is sufficiently high to preclude observation of individual features. Corresponding secondary electron images show the surface topography of the specimen, which developed steps in conjunction with twinning activity. The orientation of the grain relative to the tensile axis is also shown, which will be discussed in a subsequent section.",['fig6'],[]
3.2,Results.Modeling results for mechanical behavior,"The true stress-true strain responses for VPSC and FFT models are shown with experimental data inFig. 7a. After calibration, both models showed excellent agreement with the experimental results; the maximum deviation from the experimentally observed stress was about 3% at 20% strain (Fig. 7a, inset).","['fig7', 'fig7']",[]
3.2,Results.Modeling results for mechanical behavior,"As noted previously, the ratios of latent hardening parameters for slip and twinning were varied in this work to determine which ratio most accurately represented the experimentally observed behavior. The texture index and twin volume fraction predicted by each case are shown inTable 2. The results which best fit experimental values are indicated in bold. Although the fcc-to-hcp transformation shown inFig. 5was not explicitly included in the VPSC or FFT-based models, it is implicitly assumed that deformation twins or twin bundles actually comprise nanotwin/hcp lamellae. This assumption is appropriate given widespread observation of the phase transformation along deformation twins via STEM, the morphology of the features with only several atomic layers of hcp phase, and the shear-induced formation mechanism for the hcp phase which does not require traditional nucleation and growth.",['fig5'],['tbl2']
3.2,Results.Modeling results for mechanical behavior,"The optimal results were obtained using the model with a slip/twin latent hardening ratio of 1.5/5.0. This was determined using several metrics including the fit to the experimental mechanical response, shown inFig. 7b, and texture predictions. Although all models under-predicted the initial hardening rate below approximately 10% true strain, the model with the 1.5/5.0 latent hardening ratio had the best fit at larger strains. The model with latent hardening ratio 3.0/5.0 also showed good agreement with the experimental hardening rate and the models are difficult to distinguish based on mechanical response alone. Therefore, unlike previous work with the VPSC method, the predicted twin volume fraction was also considered. This is a critical distinguishing feature of this study, since different hardening ratios produced similar predictions for mechanical behavior and texture. However, only the optimal case reported above predicted a reasonable volume fraction of deformation twins at large strains (>10 vol%).",['fig7'],[]
3.3,Results.Modeling and experimental results for texture development,"Texture development and orientation changes during deformation were monitored via EBSD. The same region was tracked after each iteration of testing with several experimental inverse pole figures and orientation maps shown inFig. 8. Coloring by orientation on the inverse pole figure map is given parallel to the tensile axis. The decrease in image quality with increasing deformation is also clear from the IPF maps where the fraction of points indexed with high confidence decreased from 95% (no deformation) to 54% (30% true strain) and finally to 30% (51% true strain) on the as-deformed specimen. After re-polishing, as shown inFig. 8, the fraction of indexed points increased to 63%.","['fig8', 'fig8']",[]
3.3,Results.Modeling and experimental results for texture development,"The experimentally observed texture at the end of the test consisted primarily of a strong <111> fiber and a weaker <001> fiber.Fig. 9shows the volume fraction (calculated with 15° angular tolerance) of each fiber as a function of true strain. All measurements were acquired from the same region and grains except for the data at 51% strain, which was acquired from the re-polished specimen. Changes in the strengths of the <001>, <101>, and <111> fibers occurred most rapidly at small strains (less than 11%) with a sharp decrease in the strength of the <101> fiber and a very modest increase in the strength of the <001> fiber. After 11% strain, the strength of the <001> fiber remained essentially constant except for a small increase (∼1% of the total volume fraction) between 30% and 51% strain.",['fig9'],[]
3.3,Results.Modeling and experimental results for texture development,"In contrast, significant changes were observed for the <111> and <101> fibers, which monotonically increased and decreased respectively through the duration of the test. Although crystallographically related texture components evolved in tandem (e.g, volume fractions of both the <111> fiber and the {112}<101> rotated copper components increased), only the <111> and <001> fibers had volume fractions greater than 10% at the end of the test. The cumulative change in texture occurred smoothly rather than stepwise.",[],[]
3.3,Results.Modeling and experimental results for texture development,"Fig. 10shows a direct comparison of the volume fraction of texture components at 20% strain from the experimental results and both models. Both models reasonably captured the development of a stronger <111> fiber at the expense of the <101> fiber. In agreement with the results for the overall texture index, the FFT model consistently produced smaller deviations from the experimental measurements than the VPSC model.",['fig10'],[]
3.3,Results.Modeling and experimental results for texture development,"One significant advantage of the FFT-based model over the VPSC method is its ability to predict spatially resolved intragranular rotations. In addition to serving as another metric for comparison between simulation and experiment, these may be useful for determining the influence of starting orientation on 1) the subsequent direction of rotation, and 2) the propensity for deformation twinning during later stages of deformation.Fig. 11shows the progression of one isolated grain at true strains of 0%, 5%, 20%, and 30%, along with 2D and 3D EVP-FFT modeling results for the same grain. The inverse pole figures and corresponding maps were defined for the sample tensile axis and show two trends in grain orientation: 1) the development of large intragranular misorientations, defined here by the two points in the grain with the largest misorientation between them; and 2) changes to the average orientation of the grain relative to its initial orientation.Fig. 12shows the progression of two additional grains with different initial orientations. For all three grains, the 3D FFT-based model produced excellent qualitative agreement with both the intragranular spread and the rotation of the average orientation. In contrast, the 2D FFT-based model incorrectly predicted changes to the average orientation. For example, the 2D result inFig. 11shows rotation towards the <111> - <101> line and the <101> fiber that wasn't observed experimentally or in the 3D model. InFig. 12b, rotation proceeds directly toward the <111> fiber without an intermediate rotation toward the <001> - <111> line. This poor fit with experimental results confirms the necessity of carefully accounting for experimental boundary conditions.","['fig11', 'fig12', 'fig11', 'fig12']",[]
3.3,Results.Modeling and experimental results for texture development,"Figs. 11 and 12also show that most grains regardless of initial orientation exhibited the same progression of rotation towards the <001> - <111> line followed by rotation towards <111>. This was consistently observed for nearly all starting orientations with two exceptions. Grains with initial orientations near <101> rotated toward <111> but did so along the <101> - <111> line; and grains with initial orientations near <001> exhibited orientation spread but little change in the average orientation, consistent with the roughly constant volume fraction of <001> grains noted above.","['fig11', 'fig12']",[]
3.3,Results.Modeling and experimental results for texture development,"Regarding the propensity for twin formation, deformation twinning was observed via EBSD for nearly all orientations. Due to poor indexing of EBSD patterns on the as-deformed sample at 51% strain, the specimen was re-polished and therefore the initial (pre-deformation) orientations of subsequently scanned regions were unknown. However, it was qualitatively observed that grains with orientations near <001>, relative to the tensile axis, exhibited fewer indexable twins and fewer dark lines typically associated with twinning in the image quality maps. Given that these orientations were relatively stable, it can be assumed that these grains also had starting orientations close to <001>.",[],[]
3.3,Results.Modeling and experimental results for texture development,"The VPSC and FFT models predicted substantially larger deformation twin volume fractions in grains with initial orientations closer to <111>. This is shown for a variety of isolated grains inFig. 13using the predicted twin volume fraction, which was calculated with the FFT model by dividing the total accumulated twinning shear by the characteristic twinning shear. The near-<111> grain with the largest twin fraction inFig. 13is also shown with a progression of ECCI results inFig. 6. At 5% strain, the predicted volume fraction of twins was negligible, which is consistent with the separated defects visible at high magnification inFig. 6. The predicted volume fraction was still less than 0.05 at 14% strain but rapidly increased to approximately 0.15 at 30% strain. Direct comparison of modeling results to the experiment were challenging due to the extremely fine nature of the deformation twins, which made them difficult to distinguish from the slip traces developed at lower strains. However, assuming an average twin bundle thickness on the order of 100 nm and typical spacings of approximately 600 nm between twins at intermediate and large deformations (as measured via EBSD and some clearly distinguishable regions via ECCI), a 10 μm line would contain ∼1.7 μm of twinned material for an estimated volume fraction of 0.17. This is in reasonable agreement with the predictions made by the FFT model, which range from approximately 0.01 to 0.26 depending on the initial orientation of the grain.","['fig13', 'fig13', 'fig6', 'fig6']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Deformation at low strains and the onset of twinning,"The mechanical properties and deformation mechanisms are typical of those observed in the recent literature; for example, Laplanche et al. reported yield and ultimate tensile strengths of 360 ± 10 MPa and ∼870 MPa (engineering stress), respectively, at room temperature for an average grain size of 16 μm, which is consistent with the values measured in this work after accounting for grain size differences [52].",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Deformation at low strains and the onset of twinning,"The precise onset of deformation twinning in this study is less certain; although very fine deformation twins were first visible via ECCI in select grains at 14% true strain (∼770 MPa), the strain hardening rate changes much earlier around 9% (∼620 MPa), suggesting twins may initiate at this stress. It is expected that the lower value is more accurate in this case because ECCI has limited ability to resolve deformation twins with thicknesses below approximately 10 nm, so newly initiated twins at lower macroscopic strains (e.g, 8% or 11%) might not have been visible. The correspondence between a substantial change in strain-hardening rate and the onset of twinning has also been explicitly observed in previous work. For example, Barbier et al. noted the appearance of deformation twins immediately after a similar change in strain hardening rate for Fe – 22Mn – 0.6C TWIP steel [25]; Gutierrez-Urrutia and Raabe also reported the activation of a single primary twin system corresponding to this change in the same TWIP alloy [8].",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Deformation at low strains and the onset of twinning,"If the change in work-hardening rate corresponds to the onset of twinning, the value in this work is somewhat lower than that reported by Laplanche et al. [11] in the same material. Based on scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) observations, they reported the onset of twinning between 9.7% and 12.9% for an estimated temperature-independent twinning stress of ∼790 ± 100 MPa. One possible reason for this discrepancy is that, as found clearly in the present work, the initial orientation of the grains strongly influences their propensity to undergo deformation twinning. Since the measurements for the onset of twinning were derived from STEM observations in the Laplanche work, only limited regions would have been available for study and the probability of encountering a grain ideally suited for twinning would be low. The lack of observed twins at 9.7% true strain in the previous study may be the result of a relatively small sample size that failed to capture any grains with ideal twinning orientations. Note that in the present work, less than 20% of the volume was estimated to have an orientation within 15° of the <111> fiber at 10% true strain. Since the limited number of grains with initial orientations near <111> (relative to the tensile axis) will begin twinning first, ∼80% of the volume would not be expected to exhibit deformation twins even after twinning was activated in favorable grains. Additionally, estimates made from the mechanical data published by Laplanche et al. suggest a change in the slope of the hardening curve closer to 4% true strain (true stress ∼540 MPa). Further study will be necessary to clarify when twinning begins with respect to accumulated strain. Given the extremely fine nature of early twin structures, and the orientation dependence reported in this work, STEM should be employed specifically on grains with ideal orientations that promote twinning. In this connection, it is worth noting that a recent study [53] of single-crystal CrMnFeCoNi found that twinning depended strongly on orientation, with some orientations twinning easily and others hardly at all. In this single-crystal study, the twinning CRSS was determined to be 153 MPa, which is significantly lower than that estimated for the same alloy by STEM analyses of samples extracted from the deformed gage sections of polycrystalline tensile specimens with ∼17 μm grain size, ∼235 MPa [11]. As discussed earlier, the difference between the two values may be due to the difficulty in identifying the real onset of twinning in polycrystalline material when only small areas in the gauge sections are examined by STEM and also due to grain size effects since twinning is known to become more difficult as the grain size decreases [53].",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Deformation at low strains and the onset of twinning,"One additional point of interest regarding the deformed microstructure at early stages is that significant orientation spread (i.e, intragranular misorientation) occurred unambiguously before the onset of twinning. This may be the result of multiple slip, which was clearly initiated prior to 5% strain. Low stacking fault energy also contributes substantially to this behavior since more widely separated partial dislocations inhibit cross-slip, which enhances the hardening response and promotes intragranular rotation. This supports previous observations that texture development is driven primarily by slip rather than deformation twinning [30,31].",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Differences between CrCoNi and TWIP steels,"The final texture along the tensile axis in CrCoNi is qualitatively similar to that developed in many TWIP steels (and other fcc materials) with a strong <111> fiber and a weaker <001> fiber [26,30,31]. However, examination of quantitative texture measurements reveals notable differences. The most prominent example is the volume fraction of the <001> fiber, which remained essentially constant around ∼10% in this work but has been shown to increase from approximately 8% to 17% in Fe – 22Mn – 0.6C TWIP steel [25]. In that work, Barbier et al. noted that twins forming in <111>-oriented grains reinforced the <001> fiber and attributed the strengthening of that component to deformation twinning. Saleh et al. also observed relative increases in the volume fraction of the Goss {110}<001> and cube {001}<100> texture components, which both belong to the <001> fiber. As noted above, these changes were not observed in CrCoNi.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Differences between CrCoNi and TWIP steels,"Given the fine structure of the deformation twins, which were not indexed in the large EBSD scan used for texture measurements in the present work, it is likely that their contribution to the overall texture was not captured. Comparison of EBSD and XRD measurements for the <001> fiber in future studies may provide experimental insight regarding the effect of twins on the overall texture and specifically the strength of the <001> fiber. If the estimated volume fraction for the <001> fiber is stronger in XRD measurements, one possibility is that finer EBSD measurements are required. However, it is unlikely that this observed difference between CrCoNi and the TWIP steels is due to measurement technique alone; several other texture components are notably different, including the rotated copper and brass texture components that comprise a significant fraction of highly deformed TWIP steels but never exceed 10 vol% of CrCoNi. These components would be unaffected by any reorientation involving twins and should therefore be largely indifferent to the resolution of the EBSD scan.",[],[]
4.3,Discussion.Comparison of VPSC and EVP-FFT methods,"Both VPSC and EVP-FFT modeling frameworks produced results showing good agreement with experimental measurements of mechanical response and texture development. Comparisons were more favorable to the EVP-FFT model for both the overall texture index and individual texture components. Both models modestly overpredicted the <001> fiber and under-predicted the strength of the <101> fiber relative to the experiment. However, it is again noted that neither model contained a twin reorientation scheme and comparison of individual grains provides evidence that the discrepancy for the <101> fiber cannot be related to missing twins in the EBSD data. For example, the <101> grain inFig. 12a shows that EVP-FFT modeling predicts a more rapid grain rotation and larger intragranular misorientation than is experimentally observed. These discrepancies may be related to the observation of a two-dimensional surface of a three-dimensional material. It is expected that model performance could be further improved, especially for the EVP-FFT case, by using a 3D EBSD data set for the initial measurement. One obvious shortcoming in that case is that producing such a dataset is destructive and would therefore preclude monitoring of the same region throughout the experimental test. High energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM) using synchrotron radiation is a non-destructive alternative that could also provide 3D spatial and orientation information resolved in time. However, given the use of 2D datasets and simple assumptions regarding hardening behavior, the EVP-FFT model in this work is considered to have produced excellent agreement with experimentally observed behavior.",['fig12'],[]
4.4,Discussion.Influence of deformation twin/hcp lamellae on hardening,Atomistic simulations by Niu et al. suggest that mixed and edge dislocations are effectively unable to penetrate nanotwin/hcp lamellae and are instead forced to shear along those features [17]. This was proposed to distribute damaging stress concentrations and thereby promote large hardening rates and ductility.,[],[]
4.4,Discussion.Influence of deformation twin/hcp lamellae on hardening,"The results from the current work offer support for this hypothesis. The VPSC models deliberately varied the latent hardening parameters for slip and twinning systems to determine how those affected the macroscopic stress-strain response, texture evolution, and the twin volume fraction. The latent hardening parameters should be directly related to the effect described above: if the hypothesis is correct and twin/hcp lamellae globally act as profound barriers to further dislocation motion, those systems should have large latent hardening parameters for non-coplanar systems. In fact, this result was observed: the optimal simulations had a hardening ratio of 5/1.5 for twin latent hardening and slip latent hardening (respectively) or equivalently when twins promote ∼3x as much hardening as slip. Although this result is derived from insights based on modeling, we emphasize the close agreement between experiment and model on a wide array of metrics including the true-stress strain response, hardening behavior, texture evolution at the macroscopic scale as well as in individual grains, and estimates of the deformation twin volume fraction.",[],[]
4.4,Discussion.Influence of deformation twin/hcp lamellae on hardening,"Although it is evident that twinning systems provide greater hardening than slip, it is important to ascertain whether the large ratio of twin/slip latent hardening would be substantially different in an alloy with more traditional deformation twinning and no hcp formation. Unfortunately, there are limited data in the literature for comparisons of hardening parameters; however, Saleh et al. performed similar VPSC calculations for a TWIP steel (Fe-24Mn-3Al-2Si-1Ni-0.06C) using similar variations in the hardening ratios [31]. In that work, poor correspondence was found between experimental data and a model assuming a hardening ratio of 5/1 for twin and slip latent hardening. This primarily manifested in unfavorable quantitative comparisons of texture evolution; specifically, high latent hardening from twins in that simulation hindered slip and decreased the rate of texture evolution with strain, so the final simulated result showed weaker texture than corresponding experiments. The optimal VPSC model in that work used a 1/1 hardening ratio for twin and slip latent hardening, suggesting approximately equal non-coplanar hardening contributions from each. This represents a significant difference from the optimal model employed in the present work and supports the hypothesis that twin/hcp lamellae enhance macroscopic hardening behavior in a meaningful way. However, it should be noted that the alloy studied by Saleh et al. had a lower yield stress and lower hardening rates; for more definitive evidence, comparisons should be made for a twinning alloy with a similar grain size, shear modulus, and hardening rate.",[],[]
5,Conclusions,"Interrupted tensile testing was performed on equimolar CrCoNi to study texture evolution and thereby correlate nanoscale deformation mechanisms with macroscopically observed hardening behavior. Simulations were performed using mean-field VPSC and full-field EVP-FFT models. Faster computation in the VPSC model was leveraged to study how changing the ratio of latent hardening parameters for slip and twinning affected the fit between simulation and experiment. These results informed the choice of parameters for the EVP-FFT model, which was used to study intragranular rotation and the influence of a grain's initial orientation on its propensity for deformation twinning.1.As measured using EBSD, nearly all initial orientations rotated in the same direction to develop a strong <111> texture along the tensile axis while <001>-oriented grains remained stable. Although this is qualitatively similar to observations in Fe-based TWIP steels and other fcc materials, it differs in both the degree of overall texture (lower in CrCoNi) and in the presence of specific texture components such as the rotated copper and brass components (significant in TWIP steels, marginal in CrCoNi).2.ECCI showed that deformation was accommodated by slip of dissociated partial dislocations. Deformation twins and nanotwin/hcp lamellae were also observed at large strains.3.Comparison of the experimental data with VPSC modeling results indicated an essentially negligible role for deformation twinning in texture development, despite its strong contribution to the hardening behavior of the material. Instead, texture development was primarily driven by slip.4.The full-field EVP-FFT modeling framework produced excellent agreement with experimental data with respect to the mechanical response and texture evolution (for both intragranular rotation in individual grains and behavior at coarser length scales). Although the mean-field VPSC model was useful for examining behavior at large strains, its inability to account for a grain neighborhood effect made it less accurate than the full-field method.5.For the VPSC model which best fit the data (considering mechanical response, texture, and twin volume fraction), deformation twins produced more latent hardening on non-coplanar systems than slip by a factor of approximately three. This is larger than in traditional TWIP steels where the ratio of non-coplanar hardening is approximately one (i.e, deformation twinning and slip have a roughly equal hardening effect on the other deformation systems). This new result for CrCoNi is interpreted as a consequence of nanoscale twin/hcp lamellae formation, which presents a formidable barrier to subsequent dislocation motion.",[],[]
