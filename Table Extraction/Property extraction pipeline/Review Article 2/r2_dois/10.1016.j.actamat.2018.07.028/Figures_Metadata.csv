fig1,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.07.028/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,"(a) Schematic of the tensile sample geometry including the specimen coordinate system (b) An inverse pole figure map along the specimen tensile axis (i.e, <010>) shows the fully recrystallized grain structure before testing; (c) EDS maps show the homogeneous elemental distribution in CrCoNi."
fig2,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.07.028/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,"True stress-strain curves for equiatomic CrCoNi. The red and blue curves show the interrupted test with unloading-loading segments preserved and removed, respectively; the broken black curves show results from a typical uninterrupted test, including the hardening rate up to the end of uniform elongation. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the Web version of this article.)"
fig3,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.07.028/figures/gr3.jpg,Fig. 3,"Deformed microstructure at 5% true strain: (a) multiple active slip systems are visible at low magnification, and (b) higher magnification reveals individual dislocations and extended stacking faults. (c) The orientation and position of the same region as shown in an inverse pole figure map."
fig4,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.07.028/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,"Deformed microstructure at 51% true strain after re-polishing: (a) IPF map showing the orientation parallel to the tensile axis, and (b) <345> zone axis ECCI from the same region showing a high density of deformation twins."
fig5,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.07.028/figures/gr5.jpg,Fig. 5,"STEM characterization of deformation substructure in CrCoNi alloy at room temperature: (a) and (b) HAADF-STEM image and corresponding center of symmetry (COS) map of a deformation twin, (c) and (d) HAADF-STEM image and corresponding COS map of the formation of four-layer hcp phase near a deformation twin, (e) and (f) HAADF-STEM image and corresponding COS map of a well-developed nanotwin-hcp lamella. (All STEM images were obtained along [101]fcc)."
fig6,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.07.028/figures/gr6.jpg,Fig. 6,Changes in deformation substructure with increasing strain. BSE images in the left column show dislocation and twin structure; SE images in the right column show the corresponding topological changes at larger strains. The orientation of the grain relative to the tensile axis at 5% true strain is shown in IPF map at the top right. This grain corresponds to the simulated grain with the highest twin volume fraction inFig. 13.
fig7,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.07.028/figures/gr7.jpg,Fig. 7,"(a) Comparison of experimental data to VPSC and FFT-based models. Inset shows magnified portion of curves around 20% true strain. (b) Predicted stress-strain curves using different Voce hardening parameters. Multiple sets of parameters can correctly predict the mechanical behavior and texture evolution, but only one optimized set of parameters can produce reasonable predictions for the twin volume fraction."
fig8,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.07.028/figures/gr8.jpg,Fig. 8,"Inverse pole figure maps and triangles parallel to the tensile axis for the same region at true strains of (a) 0%, (b) 8%, (c) 20%, and (d) 51%. The final result for the re-polished specimen does not show the same region."
fig9,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2018.07.028/figures/gr9.jpg,Fig. 9,Evolution of the volume fraction of different texture components as a function of true strain. All measurements were performed on the same region except the final measurement at 51% true strain.

The overall fraction is shown in (a) while the EVP-FFT results are shown for selected initial orientations in (b).
