0,Abstract,"A novel Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10 high entropy alloy composed mostly of inexpensive components was produced by vacuum arc melting. In the as-cast condition the alloy had a dual-phase structure consisted of a bcc matrix and homogeneously distributed in the matrix cuboidal B2 ordered particles. The matrix phase was enriched with Fe and Cr, and B2 particles were composed mostly of Ni and Al. The alloy had high compression yield strength of 940–990 MPa at temperatures up to 400 °C. Further increase in temperature resulted in pronounced softening. The alloy could be compressed to 50% reduction without fracture at room temperature, but had a limited tensile ductility, especially at room temperature – elongation to fracture was only 2.5%. Annealing at 1200 °C did not change the structure of the alloy noticeably, but after annealing at 1000 °C an additional fcc phase appeared. The formation of the fcc phase caused pronounced softening. The comparison of the experimental results on the phase composition of the alloy with CALPHAD predictions showed reasonable agreement. Possibilities to increase stability of dual bcc-B2 structure were discussed.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The so-called high entropy alloys (HEAs), usually defined as alloys composed of at least five principal elements with concentrations from 5 to 35 at.%[1], have recently emerged as a new class of metallic alloys with promising mechanical characteristics[2,3]. The initial concept of HEAs relied on an increase in mixing entropy of disordered solid solutions due to a high number of components with nearly equiatomic concentrations to stabilize these high entropy solid solution phases in favor of ordered or intermetallic ones[1]. However, further work has revealed that high mixing entropy is not the sufficient or necessary condition to cause the formation of solid solution phases and actually only a small fraction of the alloys that fulfill the compositional requirements of HEAs has solid solution structure[4–7]. Nevertheless, many of HEAs demonstrate very attractive mechanical properties[8–10], which can often be attributed to the presence of ordered or intermetallic phases[11–16]. This is not surprising, taking in mind that many high-performance commercial alloys heavily rely on the presence of second phases to provide the required characteristics[17]. Probably, the best-known examples are nickel-based superalloys composed of a gamma (fcc) matrix with high volume fraction of cuboidal gamma prime (L12ordered fcc) precipitates[18].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"One of the promising potential applications of HEAs is to use them at high temperatures[8,11,13,15,16,19–21]. Due to impressive high-temperature properties of nickel-based superalloys, especially their high strength at elevated temperatures, efforts have been undertaken to mimic their characteristic gamma-gamma prime microstructure in high entropy alloys[22]. Such alloys have even been referred as special sub-class of HEAs – high entropy superalloys[23]. Some of them offer improved strength[24]or oxidation resistance[25]in comparison with currently used commercial superalloys. However, in general, their compositions and properties are rather close to the conventional superalloys. For example, both the high entropy and usual superalloys contain a similar amount of heavy and expensive Ni and Co (in sum)[22]. Even some newly developed promising HEAs strengthened by L12or B2 (ordered bcc) phases - like AlCoCrFeNi2.1[26,27], (FeCoNiCr)94Ti2Al4[28]or Al0.7CoCrFe2Ni[29]- also contain a lot of Ni and Co that can substantially limit their potential applications.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Taking into account the above-mentioned issues, it seems interesting to explore the formation of a superalloy-like microstructure in HEAs with the low(er) content of Ni and Co. To this point, such possibility has never been explored. In this paper, we present structure and mechanical properties of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10high entropy alloy. The alloy was designed by adding Al to fcc-structured Fe40Mn28Cr18Ni14multicomponent alloy reported earlier[30].",[],[]
2,Materials and methods,The Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy (subscripts indicate the nominal content of the corresponding elements in at.%; hereinafter all compositions are given in at.%) was produced by vacuum arc melting of the high-purity (at least 99.9%) constitutive elements. The produced ingot had dimensions of ∼10 × 15 × 60 mm3. The ingot was remelted 5 times to ensure chemical homogeneity. SEM-EDX analysis showed that actual chemical composition of the alloys corresponded to nominal ones (Table 1). The specimens for microstructural characterization were cut from the produced ingot by electric discharge machine. Some specimens were annealed either at 1000 °C or 1200 °C for 24 h in vaccumized quartz tubes and cooled down on air.,[],['tbl1']
2,Materials and methods,"Microstructure and phase composition of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy were studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning (SEM) and transmission (TEM) electron microscopy techniques. The XRD analysis was performed using a RIGAKU diffractometer and Cu Kα radiation. Samples for SEM observations were prepared by careful mechanical polishing. SEM investigations were performed utilizing a FEI Quanta 600 FEG and a Nova NanoSEM 450 field emission gun (FEG) microscopes equipped with a back-scattered electron (BSE) and an energy-dispersive (EDS) detectors, and an EBSD (electron backscattered diffraction) cameras. The samples for the TEM analysis were prepared by the conventional twin-jet electro-polishing of mechanically pre-thinned to 100 μm foils, in a mixture of 95% C2H5OH and 5% HClO4at the 27 V potential. The TEM investigations were performed using a JEOL JEM-2100 microscope equipped with an EDS detector at accelerating voltage of 200 kV. The volume fractions of different phases were measured from SEM-BSE images using Digimizer Image Analysis Software.",[],[]
2,Materials and methods,"Vickers microhardness of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy in different conditions was measured using a 250 g load applied for 15 s. 20 measurements were made for each condition. Compression and tensile mechanical tests were performed using the samples of the alloy in the as-cast condition. Testing was performed utilizing Instron machines equipped with radial heating furnaces. Rectangular specimens with dimensions of 7 × 5 × 5 mm3and dog-bone specimens with gauge dimensions of 1.5 × 3 × 5 mm3respectively for compression and tensile testing were cut using an electric discharge machine. Prior to testing, the specimens were carefully mechanically polished. Compression testing was performed at an initial strain rate of 10−4s−1until 50% height reduction. Tensile testing to fracture was carried out at an initial strain rate of 10−3s−1. Elongation to fracture was determined by measurements of spacing between marks designating the gauge length before and after the test. The tests were conducted at room (25 °C) and elevated (400, 500, 600 and 800 °C (the latter temperature – only for compression testing)) temperatures. For the elevated temperature testing, the specimens were placed in the preheated to testing temperature furnace and held for ≈10 min to equilibrate the temperature prior to testing. The temperature of the specimens was controlled by a thermocouple attached to the side surface of the specimens. The density of the alloy was measured by hydrostatic weighting method. Measurements were performed on three compression specimens (see above) and the presented value is the average of three measurements.",[],[]

3.1,Results.Structure of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy in the as-cast condition,"Fig. 1shows XRD pattern (Fig. 1a), SEM-BSE image (Fig. 1b) and TEM images (Fig. 1≿ and d) of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10high entropy alloy structure in the as-cast condition. The results of chemical analysis obtained using SEM- and TEM-based EDS are shown inTable 1. The XRD analysis reveals the presence of two bcc phases (designated as BCC1 and BCC2 inFig. 1a; the former has much higher intensity of diffraction peaks,) with slightly different lattice parameters – 2.883 nm and 2.899 nm, respectively. From the low magnification SEM-BSE image (Fig. 1b) one can assume that the alloy has a single phase structure. However, a closer look (high magnification insert inFig. 1b) demonstrates the presence of fine, uniformly distributed cuboidal second phase particles inside the matrix phase. The mean size of the matrix grains is 100 ± 45 μm. The TEM analysis (Fig. 1c–d) confirms the presence of cuboidal second phase particles with the average size of 160 ± 30 nm. The volume fraction of the second phase particles is 50%. The analysis of the selected area electron diffraction patterns (insert inFig. 1d) has revealed that the particles have an ordered bcc B2 structure, while the matrix phase has a disordered bcc structure. The measurements of the chemical composition of the phases (Table 1) have demonstrated that the B2 particles are enriched with Al and Ni, while the matrix is enriched with Cr and Fe. Note that Mn is almost homogeneously distributed between the phases. The measured density of the alloy is 7.18 g/cm3. This value is comparable but yet slightly lower than the density of some HEAs with higher content of Ni and/or Co (AlCoCrFeNi2.1alloy – 7.38 g/cm3[26]).","['fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1']","['tbl1', 'tbl1']"
3.2,Results.Mechanical properties of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy,"The stress-strain curves obtained during compression and tensile testing of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy in the as-cast condition at different temperatures are shownFig. 2a and b, respectively. The resulting mechanical properties, namely yield strength (σ0.2), ultimate tensile strength (σUTS), and fracture strain (ε) are summarized inTable 2. At room temperature, the alloy demonstrates relatively high yield strength of 990 MPa in compression. After yielding, the alloy demonstrates continuous strengthening and reaches 50% height reduction without fracture. The increase in testing temperature results in a decrease of the yield strength. The strain hardening capacity of the alloy also gradually diminishes and at 600 and 800 °C a steady-state flow stage with the constant stress level is observed soon after yielding. At all tested temperatures, the alloy maintains high compression ductility and can be strained to 50% reduction.",['fig2'],['tbl2']
3.2,Results.Mechanical properties of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy,"At room temperature the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy has in tension the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of 750 and 880 MPa respectively (Fig. 2a,Table 2). However, the tensile ductility of the alloy is very limited – the specimen fractures shortly after yielding. The increase of the testing temperature to 400 °C results in a decrease of yield strength, while the ultimate tensile strength at 400° is even slightly higher than that at room temperature. The alloy also demonstrates moderate ductility with an elongation to fracture of 20%. At yet higher temperatures (500 and 600 °C) the yield strength and ultimate tensile strength of the alloy further decrease and ductility increases (Fig. 2a,Table 2). However, the shape of stress-strain curves at 400–600 °C consisting of the short hardening stage and prolonged softening after reaching peak stress suggests a short stage of the uniform elongation while the most part of the total elongation to fracture is associated with the localized deformation.","['fig2', 'fig2']","['tbl2', 'tbl2']"
3.3,Results.Effect of annealing on structure and microhardness of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy,"To examine the phase stability the as-cast Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy was annealed at 1000 and 1200 °C for 24 h. The microstructure of the annealed alloy is illustrated inFig. 3, and the chemical composition of the structural constituents of the alloy after annealing at 1000 °C is given inTable 3. The microhardness of the alloy in different conditions is presented inTable 4. After annealing at 1200 °C the general appearance of the microstructure remains similar to that in the as-cast condition (Fig. 3a). The XRD analysis (not shown) also does not reveal noticeable changes. Note, however, that the second (B2) phase particles attain almost perfect cuboidal shape with straight interphase boundaries, and the fraction of B2 phase decreases to 39%. The size of B2 phase particles is larger than in the as-cast condition - 220 ± 40 nm. A slight increase of microhardness by ∼30 HV due to annealing at 1200 °C is also observed (Table 4).","['fig3', 'fig3']","['tbl3', 'tbl4', 'tbl4']"
3.3,Results.Effect of annealing on structure and microhardness of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy,"Annealing at a lower temperature of 1000 °C drastically changes the structure of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy (Fig. 3b). First of all, areas free from precipitates are observed, mostly along the initial bcc grain boundaries. In the vicinity of these areas coarse B2 particles with the average sizes of 5–10 μm are found. The shape of fine B2 particles becomes much more irregular in comparison with the as-cast condition, and their size increases to ∼0.35 μm. XRD (not shown) and EBSD analysis (Fig. 3c) reveals the presence of an fcc phase in addition to the bcc and B2 (EBSD does not distinguish bcc and ordered B2 phases due to limited sensitivity). Moreover, EBSD phase map suggests that the precipitate free-areas visible in the SEM-BSE image (Fig. 3b) have fcc structure. Chemical composition analysis (Table 3) demonstrates that the fcc phase is enriched with Fe and Mn, coarse B2 particles are primarily composed of Ni and Al, and the bcc matrix with fine B2 particles has an almost nominal composition of the alloy. The volume fractions of the bcc, B2, and fcc phases are 41%, 30%, and 29% respectively. Structural transformations after annealing at 1000 °C are accompanied with the prominent decrease of microhardness down to 310 HV (Table 4).","['fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3']","['tbl3', 'tbl4']"
3.4,Results.Predicted phase diagram of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy,"The equilibrium phase diagram of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy calculated with Thermo-Calc software is shown inFig. 4. The predicted fractions and chemical compositions of constitutive equilibrium phases at selected temperatures are given inTable 5. The predicted liquidus and solidus temperatures are respectively 1425 °C and 1305 °C, and the alloy is expected to solidify through a single disordered bcc phase. The bcc phase is expected to be the only equilibrium phase of the alloy down to ∼1000 °C, and at lower temperatures ordered (B2) bcc and fcc phases precipitate. The predicted solvus temperatures of the B2 and fcc phases are 992 °C and 987 °C, respectively. The fractions of the B2 and fcc phases continuously increase with a decrease in temperature, and the fraction of the fcc phase is several times higher than that of the B2 phase. For example, at 800 °C, the predicted fractions of the bcc, B2, and fcc phases are 0.448, 0.119 and 0.433 respectively (Table 5). At ∼725–735 °C the bcc and (partially) fcc phases transform into a sigma and (partially) the B2 phases according to the predicted phase diagram. With a further decrease in temperature, the fractions of the sigma and B2 phases increase and the fraction of the fcc phase decreases. As the result, in equilibrium at 600 °C the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy is expected to consist of the sigma, B2 and fcc phases with the fractions of 0.558, 0.240 and 0.202 respectively. According to the predictions, the bcc phase is expected to be enriched with Fe and Cr and to be depleted of Ni and Al, the B2 phase is expected to be composed mainly of Ni and Al. In turn, the fcc phase is expected to be enriched with Fe and Mn and to be depleted of Al and Cr, and sigma phase is expected to contain Fe, Cr, and Mn.",['fig4'],"['tbl5', 'tbl5']"
4,Discussion,"The presented data show that the addition of 10 at.% of Al to the developed Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy drastically changes the “base” Fe40Mn28Cr18Ni14alloy[30]. The Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy is composed (mostly) of bcc phases including the B2 ordered one, while the Fe40Mn28Cr18Ni14alloy has a single fcc phase structure. The transformation of the fcc to the bcc-based structure due to Al addition to the Co-Cr-Fe-Ni-Mn system based HEAs is well studied on examples of AlxCoCrFeNi[31,32], AlxCoCrFeNiMn[33], or AlxFeCoCrNi2-x[34]alloys, as well as on similar transition metals based alloys like AlxCuCrFeNi2[35,36]. These findings were interpreted in terms of average valence electron concentration (VEC): it was established that the alloys with VEC≥8.0 are prone to fcc phase formation, the alloys with VEC<6.87 tend to have a bcc structure, and in alloys with intermediate VEC values a mixed structure is observed[37]. The calculated VEC values of the Fe40Mn28Cr18Ni14and Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloys are respectively 7.64 and 7.23, i.e. both alloy fell into the area where both bcc and fcc phases are expected. Thus the VEC criterion cannot correctly predict the transformation of the fcc-structured Fe40Mn28Cr18Ni14alloy to the bcc-structured Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy due to Al addition. Possibly, this is due to large amount of Mn in the alloys, as the VEC criterion was found to give poor results for the Mn-containing HEAs[37].",[],[]
4,Discussion,"More precise predictions can be possibly made using the CALPHAD method[6,7,35,38]. Indeed, according to the predicted equilibrium phase diagram (Fig. 4) the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy should solidify through the single disordered bcc phase, while the equilibrium ordered B2 phase is expected to precipitate at temperatures lower than ∼1000 °C. The observed microstructure of the alloy in the as-cast condition (Fig. 1) – the granular bcc matrix with the fine B2 particles which most likely precipitated during cooling – is in a reasonable agreement with the predicted solidification path for the alloy. The calculated phase diagram for the Fe40Mn28Cr18Ni14alloy (Fig. 5a) suggests that the major phase of the alloy is fcc. Small fractions of the bcc phase are expected during and shortly after solidification and at temperatures below ∼950 °C; nevertheless the fraction of the fcc phase is >0.95 from the solidus temperature to 800 °C. The results of the thermodynamic simulations are in a reasonable agreement with the experimentally observed single fcc phase structure in the alloy after annealing at 850 °C. Therefore, it might be concluded that the application of the CALPHAD methods to the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10and Fe40Mn28Cr18Ni14alloys (i) adequately predicts their phase composition; (ii) correctly predicts the transformation of the fcc structure of the Fe40Mn28Cr18Ni14alloy to the bcc-based structure of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy.","['fig4', 'fig1', 'fig5']",[]
4,Discussion,"The formation of the disordered fcc phase in the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy (experimentally observed after annealing at 1000 °C;Fig. 3b and c) can also be anticipated from the predicted phase diagram. The fcc phase appears predominantly on the initial bcc grain boundaries and causes significant coarsening of the adjacent B2 phase particles (Fig. 3b). Therefore annealing at 1000 °C has strong negative effect on microhardness of the alloy (Table 4). Thus, the formation of the fcc phase should be avoided. The Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy contains strong fcc-stabilizing elements like Mn or Ni. Their replacement with bcc-stabilizing elements already present in the alloy (Cr, Al) or addition of other bcc stabilizes should increase the stability of the bcc and B2 phases.Fig. 5b shows predicted phase diagram of the Fe35Mn20Cr17Ni12Al12Ti4alloy which contains less Mn and Ni but more Al and Ti (Ti is known to be strong bcc stabilizer) than the studied Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy. Phase diagram suggests that the Fe35Mn20Cr17Ni12Al12Ti4alloy (i) has broader bcc+B2 phase field with a higher fraction of ordered B2; (ii) the fcc phase is replaced with ordered C15 (fcc) Laves phase with the solvus temperature ∼100 °C lower than that of the fcc phase in the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy. These factors are supposed to make the Fe35Mn20Cr17Ni12Al12Ti4alloy better candidate for high-temperature usage than the current Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy. Nevertheless, experimental studies are required to evaluate the structure and mechanical properties of the proposed Fe35Mn20Cr17Ni12Al12Ti4alloy.","['fig3', 'fig3', 'fig5']",['tbl4']
4,Discussion,"Although CALPHAD method providesqualitativelyreasonable results on the phase composition of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy, it is necessary to mention thatquantitativelythe experimental results do not agree with the predictions. For example, the calculated phase diagram (Fig. 4) predicts: (i) extremely narrow bcc+B2 field in the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy (the solvus temperature of the B2 phase is 992 °C, and the solvus temperature of the fcc phase is 987 °C); (ii) low fraction of the B2 phase (only ∼12% at 800 °C (Table 5)). The similar bcc+B2 structure of the alloy both in the as-cast (Fig. 1) and in annealed at 1200 °C (Fig. 3a) conditions implies the vast two-phase bcc+B2 field. The experimental fraction of the B2 phase is also much higher than the predicted ones – 30–50% depending on the exact condition. CALPHAD method is known to provide an inaccurate prediction of the phase transformation temperatures, fractions and composition of constitutive phases in case of HEAs[15,16,39,40], mostly due to limitations of the databases developed for the conventional alloys, i.e. not fully covering the composition space of HEAs[40]. In the present case, the incorrect assessment of the phase stabilities can be partially attributed to the wrongly predicted distribution of chemical elements between the phases like it has been already demonstrated for the AlxCrNbTiVZr alloys[16]. The modeling predicts that Mn tends to the bcc phase when the B2 phase is formed (Table 5) thus making the fcc phase formation more probable. However, the experimental results demonstrate that Mn is nearly equally distributed in the bcc and B2 phases (Table 2). This is likely one of the reasons why the bcc+B2 structure in the experimental alloy is more stable than it is predicted.","['fig4', 'fig1', 'fig3']","['tbl5', 'tbl5', 'tbl2']"
4,Discussion,"Generally, obtaining the disordered bcc-based matrix with ordered B2 precipitates in Al-containing HEAs based on transition metals is not easy as: (i) at relatively low Al concentrations, the fcc phase is found; (ii) at high Al concentration, the B2 ordered phase becomes the matrix phase[33,35,36]. Although the presence of the fcc phase can be beneficial for the room temperature ductility, it quickly softens at high temperatures[41,42]and thus can make the fcc-containing alloys not suitable for high-temperature applications. Moreover, it is likely that the multiphase fcc+bcc+B2 structure will be thermodynamically unstable (Fig. 5), which can result in drastic degradation of the alloy strength after high-temperature exposure (Table 4). If the ordered phase is the matrix phase, the alloys are generally extremely brittle at room temperature[33]. Therefore, the structure of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy seems to be one of the most promising among the reported HEAs for obtaining good mechanical properties.",['fig5'],['tbl4']
4,Discussion,"In practice, the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy demonstrates encouraging mechanical properties (Table 2), namely relatively high strength at room temperature which is maintained at temperatures up to 400 °C. At temperatures ≥500 °C, pronounced softening is observed. The alloy also demonstrates good compression ductility starting from room temperature, yet with limited uniform tensile elongations even at 600 °C. The strengthening effect of the ordered B2 particles, similarly to the nickel-based superalloys, can be mostly attributed to (i) small difference between the bcc and B2 phases lattice parameters (coherency strengthening); (ii) the energy required to build antiphase boundaries and to move dislocations in an ordered structure (ordering strengthening)[18,24,29,43]. The high-temperature mechanical behavior of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy can also be ascribed to the presence of the ordered B2 phase. It is known that B2 compounds retain nearly constant strength level at temperatures from room to about ∼0.4Tm(melting temperature), while at higher temperatures a pronounced decrease of strength is found[44]. Using the calculated phase diagram, the value of 0.4Tmof the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy can be estimated as ∼360 °C. This value correlates well with the observed preservation of high strength at temperatures up to 400 °C.",[],['tbl2']
4,Discussion,"Fig. 6shows comparison between the specific yield strength of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy, several other HEAs based on transition elements (Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6alloy with γ/γ′ structure[24], Al0.7CoCrFe2Ni alloy with mostly bcc/B2 structure[29], and AlCoCrFeNi2alloy with fcc/B2 structure[26]), commercial nickel-based superalloy Inconel 718[45]and duplex stainless steel S32205[46]. Obviously, the Ni-based Inconel 718 has the highest strength both at room and elevated temperatures and significantly outperforms the other reference alloys, and the stainless steel is the softest alloy in the most part of the examined temperature range. Among the HEAs, the Al0.7CoCrFe2Ni alloy has the highest specific strength at room temperature. However, the alloy quickly softens at elevated temperature, probably, due to the presence of the coarse fcc phase particles[29]. With an increase in temperature to 400 °C, the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy becomes the strongest among the compared HEAs. The further increase in temperature to 500–600 °C, makes the fcc-based Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6and AlCoCrFeNi2alloys stronger.",['fig6'],[]
4,Discussion,"The comparison with the other alloys clearly shows that the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy has very competitive mechanical properties, at least at temperatures up to 500–600 °C. The fact that the alloy was produced mostly using inexpensive components makes it even more attractive. The comparison between the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy and the Al10Co25Cr8Fe15Ni36Ti6, Al0.7CoCrFe2Ni, and AlCoCrFeNi2alloys simply by the cost of the raw elements shows that the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy should be ∼2–3 times cheaper than the other HEAs. Note that (i) the chemical composition of the alloy can be optimized to improve its performance (Fig. 5b); (ii) heat treatment and/or thermomechanical processing can be used to tailor the microstructure and thus increase mechanical properties (for example, annealing at 1200 °C increase the microhardness of the as-cast alloy (Table 4)). Thus, based on presented information on the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy it can be concluded that the affordable HEAs of Al-Cr-Fe-Ni-Mn system with bcc/B2 structure and high mechanical strength at temperatures up to 500–600 °C can be developed.",['fig5'],['tbl4']
5,Conclusions,"In this study, the structure and mechanical properties of the novel Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10high alloy prepared by vacuum arc melting and composed mostly of inexpensive components are reported. Following conclusions are drawn.1)In the as-cast condition, the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy is composed of a bcc matrix with a grain size of 100 μm, with embedded cuboidal B2 ordered particles with average size of 160 nm. The volume fraction of B2 phase is 50%. The bcc matrix is enriched with Fe and Cr, while B2 particles are composed mostly of Al and Ni.2)The as-cast Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy demonstrates yield strength of 750 MPa and 990 MPa in compression and tension respectively at room temperature. The yield strength only slightly decreases with the increase in testing temperature to 400 °C. The respective values of compression and tension strength are 640 MPa and 940 MPa. With further increase of the temperature, pronounced decrease of strength is observed. For example, at 600 °C tensile and compression yield strength of the alloy is 310 MPa and 360 MPa, respectively. In compression the alloy demonstrates high ductility (>50% height reduction without fracture) starting from the room temperature. However, the tensile ductility of the alloy at room temperature is limited – elongation to fracture is only 2.5%. Increase of testing temperature results in moderate increase of tensile ductility.3)After annealing at 1200 °C the structure of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy is similar to that in the as-cast state. But after annealing at 1000 °C fcc phase appears, and B2 particles become much coarser than in as-cast condition. The volume fractions of the bcc, B2, and fcc 41%, 30%, and 29% respectively after annealing at 1000 °C. Microhadness of the alloy decreases pronouncedly from 410 HV in as-cast condition to 310 HV after annealing at 1000 °C.4)Equilibrium phase diagram of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy was produced using the CALPHAD method (Thermo-Calc software). Reasonable agreement between the predicted equilibrium phases and the experimental phase composition of the alloy is observed.

The volume fraction of B2 phase is 50%. The bcc matrix is enriched with Fe and Cr, while B2 particles are composed mostly of Al and Ni.",[],[]
5,Conclusions,"The as-cast Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy demonstrates yield strength of 750 MPa and 990 MPa in compression and tension respectively at room temperature. The yield strength only slightly decreases with the increase in testing temperature to 400 °C. The respective values of compression and tension strength are 640 MPa and 940 MPa. With further increase of the temperature, pronounced decrease of strength is observed. For example, at 600 °C tensile and compression yield strength of the alloy is 310 MPa and 360 MPa, respectively. In compression the alloy demonstrates high ductility (>50% height reduction without fracture) starting from the room temperature. However, the tensile ductility of the alloy at room temperature is limited – elongation to fracture is only 2.5%. Increase of testing temperature results in moderate increase of tensile ductility.",[],[]
5,Conclusions,"After annealing at 1200 °C the structure of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy is similar to that in the as-cast state. But after annealing at 1000 °C fcc phase appears, and B2 particles become much coarser than in as-cast condition. The volume fractions of the bcc, B2, and fcc 41%, 30%, and 29% respectively after annealing at 1000 °C. Microhadness of the alloy decreases pronouncedly from 410 HV in as-cast condition to 310 HV after annealing at 1000 °C.",[],[]
5,Conclusions,Equilibrium phase diagram of the Fe36Mn21Cr18Ni15Al10alloy was produced using the CALPHAD method (Thermo-Calc software). Reasonable agreement between the predicted equilibrium phases and the experimental phase composition of the alloy is observed.
