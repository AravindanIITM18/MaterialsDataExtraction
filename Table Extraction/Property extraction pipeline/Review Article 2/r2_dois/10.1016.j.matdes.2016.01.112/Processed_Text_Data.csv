0,Abstract,"A CoCrFeNi high entropy alloy has been solidified with a high undercooling up to 300K adopting glass fluxing method. Results show that the compressive yield strength of the alloy is enhanced about 3 times: from 137MPa for a traditional casting condition to 455MPa for the samples processed at large undercooling. The enhanced mechanical properties are attributed to both the refined grain size and complex phases obtained through the supercooling method, which appears to be an efficient way to modify the microstructure and improve the properties of high entropy alloys.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The concept of high entropy alloys (HEAs) developed by Yeh et al.[1]has broken the traditional way of designing alloys. This new type of metal material brings researchers many challenges and opportunities in the field of material science and engineering. As a new field of metal materials, high entropy alloys have been reported more and more frequently in the last decade for an amount of outstanding properties such as excellent wear resistance[2–4], good high temperature strength[5], superior low-temperature fracture-resistance[6]and irradiation resistance[7]. Traditionally, these alloys mainly consist of solid solution structures[8]rather than complex intermetallic compound: the structures of HEAs are mainly solid solution such as BCC, FCC or a mixture of BCC and FCC. The equimolar systems and non-equimolar systems[9]containing more than four elements have been frequently studied so far. However, HEAs with four or less elements have also been studied for the single-phase solid solution structure such as the equiatomic ternary and quaternary alloys based on the elements Fe, Ni, Co, Cr and Mn[6,10–11].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Improving the mechanical properties of the HEAs has been one of the most interesting fields for many researchers recently. Until now, many ways were put forward to improve the mechanical properties of HEAs, e.g. thermal treatments[12–16], alloy elements addition[17–20], thermo-mechanical treatment[21,22]and controlling solidification process[23,24]. Among the solidification treatments, supercooling method is an efficient way to obtain metastable phases and refined grain structure. However, few research has been carried out to investigate the effect of supercooling method on HEAs although this method have been widely used in many alloys, such as Iron-based alloys[25]and Cobalt-based alloys[26]. Furthermore, Qian M. et al. have investigated more about analytical model for constitutional supercooling-driven grain formation and grain size prediction[27]. In this paper, the supercooling method is adopted to investigate the change of the microstructure and mechanical properties of CoCrFeNi high entropy alloy which contains the main elements of many HEAs[28,29].",[],[]
2,Material and experimental procedures,"All alloying elements with high purity (99.9wt.%) were melted in a vacuum arc melting furnace. In order to achieve a good uniformity of the composition of the samples, these materials were melted at least 5 times. The uniformity of the sample was confirmed by SEM and EDX analysis. To achieve solidification with a high undercooling, the sample with mass about 100g was put in high quality quartz tube together with B2O3glass and submitted to cyclic superheating and solidification, which was called the supercooling method. The B2O3glass was dehydrated at the 1073K for 2h at the muffle furnace and then cooled down in order to be used as coating agent in the supercooling experiment. The supercooling experiment was performed by using the high frequency induction power supply and the temperature measurement equipment. The thermal behavior of the sample was monitored by a two-color pyrometer with a relative accuracy of ±5K and a response time of 10ms. The undercooled solidified specimen were cut and then polished, etched with 30ml HCl+10ml HNO3+10ml H2O. The crystalline structure of the as-cast material and supercooled samples was characterized using DX 2700 X-ray diffractometer (XRD). A SUPRA 55 scanning electron microscope (SEM) was used for microstructure observation. The microstructure of the samples was also characterized by a FEI Tecnai G2F30 TEM. Uniaxial compression tests of the as-cast and supercooled samples were carried out by a MTS SANS CMT5105 testing machine under the strain rate of 10−3s−1.",[],[]
3,Results and discussions," Fig. 1 exhibits the cooling curve of CoCrFeNi high entropy alloy during supercooling experiments. During the cooling process, at the nucleation point, Tn=1387K, the recalescence measured by a pyrometer is clearly evidenced by a rapid rise of temperature during the release of latent heat. At Tn=1387K, a large undercooling ΔT=300K below the melting temperature (1687K) is obtained. The bulk sample (about 100g) shown in the inset of Fig. 1 . is very bright with a smooth surface, which is typical characteristic of high undercooling.","['f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3,Results and discussions,"The compressive engineering stress–strain curves of the as-cast and supercooled CoCrFeNi high entropy alloy are presented in Fig. 2 . Both the samples kept unfractured with plastic strain over 40% at the end of the compression test, indicating a good plasticity of this material. The compressive yield strength of the two samples are quite different, as the strength of supercooled CoCrFeNi high entropy alloy is nearly 3 times higher than that of the as-cast sample: increased from 137MPa for traditional as-cast condition to 455MPa for the sample processed with a large undercooling.",['f0010'],[]
3,Results and discussions,"The relation between compressive yield strength and the fracture ductility of different alloys based on CoCrFeNi HEA are exhibited in Fig. 3 . It can be seen that the as-cast CoCrFeNi alloy has excellent ductility but very poor yield strength. When more elements, e.g. Al, Cu, Mo are added, their properties evolve. The yield strength of Al0.5CoCrFeNiCu alloy under different state (as-cast and heat treated)[30], CoCrFeNiMo0.3alloy[31]are all increased to a much higher value. However, the fracture strain will be decreased to a much lower value, such as in CoCrFeNiMo0.5and CoCrFeNiTi0.5[32]. The CoCrFeNi alloy processed by supercooling technique up to 300K shows a good combination of yield strength and ductility without using more alloying elements or further treatment.",['f0015'],[]
3,Results and discussions,"To undercover the enhancing mechanism of the supercooling method, the phases and microstructure of the samples are examined. Fig. 4 . is the XRD pattern of the as-cast and supercooled CoCrFeNi alloy. It is known that CoCrFeNi HEA possesses a single-phase FCC structure[28,33]. Different from the as-cast sample with solely FCC structure, the sample solidified with a large undercooling of 300K shows a mixture of FCC and BCC phases. All diffraction peaks are much sharper at the large undercooling condition, showing the mean grain size is much smaller after high undercooling. Besides, the peaks of the phases shift to low angles (shown in the inset of Fig. 4 .), indicating the severe lattice distortion of the non-equilibrium solidified sample. The lattice parameter of the FCC matrix phase for the as-cast and undercooled samples are calculated as 3.570Å and 3.576Å, respectively.","['f0020', 'f0020']",[]
3,Results and discussions," Fig. 5 shows the microstructure of CoCrFeNi HEA solidified at as-cast (near-equilibrium) state and non-equilibrium state with the undercooling of 300K. The as-cast state possesses a dendritic microstructure. The parameter, S (μm), proposed by Qiao et al.[34]is used to estimate the size of the dendritic. In the as-cast alloy, spanning length of the individual dendrite tree is S>400μm, as shown in Fig. 5(a) . The supercooled sample contains rod- and strip-like precipitates which are distributed homogeneously in the matrix (see in Fig. 5(b) ). The grain size is hugely refined from over 400μm to about 5~10μm. Meantime, rod- and strip-like precipitates with a volume fraction of about 15% appear from the main FCC solid solution matrix. Fig. 5(c)  is the TEM image of the supercooled sample and the corresponding selected area electron diffraction (SAED) of the image. Results show that BCC phase exists and that the matrix phase is the FCC solid solution phase which is consistent with the XRD pattern.","['f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025']",[]
3,Results and discussions,"Based on the microstructure analysis shown in Figs. 4  and 5, two factors can be considered to explain this unique strength enhancing behavior. According to the Hall–Petch relation, the yield strength will be increased with smaller grain. Thus, the refined grain size by supercooling technique could be a main reason of the enhancement of the yield strength. Another factor is the BCC precipitates in the supercooled sample. As reported before, the BCC structure in high entropy alloys can obviously increase the strength[33]. Combined with the above two factors: grain refinement and BCC precipitates, the supercooled sample possesses much higher yield strength than the as-cast one.","['f0020', 'f0025']",[]
4,Conclusions,"In summary, the CoCrFeNi high entropy alloy has achieved high undercooling of 300K through the way of glass fluxing method. The compressive yield strength is enhanced significantly from 137MPa to 455MPa when the sample was further solidified with an undercooling of 300K. The microstructure of the supercooled sample was transformed from dendritic morphology with spanning length of the individual dendrite over 400μm to equiaxed fine grain morphology with grain size about 5–10μm including many rod- and strip-like BCC precipitates. The grain refinement together with the BCC precipitates are the main reasons for the enhanced compressive yield strength.",[],[]
