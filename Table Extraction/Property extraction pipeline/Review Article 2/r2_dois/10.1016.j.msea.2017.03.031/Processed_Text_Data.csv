0,Abstract,"Serrated flow behavior of CoCrFeNiMn high entropy alloy with a single face-centered cubic phase was systematically examined over a wide range of temperature and strain rate. The alloy exhibited excellent fracture-resistance with RT elongation up to 56%. Prominent serrations occurred at the medium temperature range and evolved in the sequence of A→A+B→B→B+C→C with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate. The initial small plasticity produced low density of dislocations piled up at grain boundaries and high density of dislocations were tangled to form cell substructures during subsequent severe deformation stage. Bowing and kinks of dislocations were frequently observed at 400 and 600°C. The critical strain for the onset of serrated flow decreased with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate, indicating a normal and not inverse Portevin–Le Chatelier (PLC) effect due to the thermodynamic stability of the alloy. Two temperature-dependent values of activation energy for serrated flow (                        Q                     ) were obtained. The estimated low value (116kJmol−1) implied that pipe diffusion is responsible for the pinning process of dislocations from 300 to 500°C. In contrast, a higher                         Q                      (295kJmol−1) between 500 and 600°C suggested that the pinning or unpinning process of dislocations is controlled by the most sluggish diffusion species (i.e. Ni) in the high-entropy alloy.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In recent years, multicomponent high entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted increasing research interests owing to their simple crystallographic structures and excellent properties[1–7], among which the equiatomic CoCrFeNiMn alloy draws special attention. This compositionally complex alloy consists of a single face-center-cubic (fcc) solid solution phase with high thermodynamic stability and excellent malleability[8–10]. Most importantly, its cast dendritic microstructure can be broken down by means of conventional thermomechanical processing such as homogenization and rolling followed by recovery and recrystallization[11–14]. Consequently, it has been chosen as a fundamental prototype to examine the intrinsic mechanism for mechanical behavior in high entropy alloys as the effects of secondary solid solution phases and/or intermetallic compounds are excluded.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"To date, researches have demonstrated that CoCrFeNiMn alloy exhibits impressive characteristics in mechanical properties at a wide range of temperature. For instance, its yield strength, ultimate strength and elongation to fracture were found to increase with decreasing temperature between room and liquid nitrogen temperature, where the improved degree of work hardening and fracture toughness at −196°C were associated with the nano-deformation twinning introduced new interfaces (“dynamic Hall-Petch”) which postponed the early onset of necking instability[15–17]. The alloy and its similar system showed a strong dependence of yield strength and ultimate strength on temperature between RT and 800°C[18,19], but with a weak strain-rate sensitivity[20].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"It is well known that the deformation mechanism for the conventional alloys is mainly dictated by the slip of dislocations and/or twinning. The serrations (the Portevin-Le Chateler－PLC effect), a saw-like appearance on the stress-strain curves, are frequently found in many traditional alloys including Al, Cu, Fe, Ti, Mg and Ni-based superalloys[21–26]. This phenomenon is closely related to the shear-band formation and propagation and generally interpreted as a consequence of an interaction of quasi-viscous moving dislocations with a solute atmosphere (DSA process) or shearing precipitates[27,28]. According to the characteristics of serrated flow, the serrated flow has been classified into A, B and C types[29,30]. For types A and B, the serrations begin with the pinning process during which the solutes gather to pin the moving dislocations. In both cases, the stress increases until dislocations break away from the solutes and then drops rapidly due to the unpinning effect. However, type B serration exhibits a higher oscillation frequency. In contrast, type C serration begins with an unpinning process. To take into account the temperature and strain rate dependences of critical strain for onset of serration, the various investigations of serrated flow in conventional alloys suggest that the evaluation of activation energy for serrated flow is essential to clarify the underlying mechanism, where the solutes responsible for the pining or unpinning process should be verified. As a result, the discrete substitutional solutes, i.e. Mo and Cr or interstitial atoms, i.e. C and N in conventional alloys have been proposed to participate in the interactions with moving dislocations.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Different from the traditional dilute solution alloys, the nature of obstacles in equiatomic high entropy alloys is still an interesting topic and to some extent an open question because there is no “solvent” or “solute” in the traditional sense. As the interaction between diffusing solutes and moving dislocations is a thermal activation process, higher energy is naturally needed to overcome obstacles in equal atomic concentration alloys. Under such a circumstance, short-range clustering (SRC) or short-range order (SRO) was likely to take effect[18]or it is more appropriate to consider the dislocation as moving through a mythical “average solvent” or “effect medium”[19]. Moreover, the thermal activated process is believed to be dominated by long-range bowing of non-straight dislocations[31]. Unfortunately, little information has been available in the literature on serrated behavior in HEAs and almost the limited stress-strain curves were obtained using compressive tests on several body-center-cubic- (bcc) and fcc-structured HEAs[32–34]. It was found that serrations depend on composition of the alloys, temperature and strain rate. Theoretically, the coarse-grained mean-field theory (MFT) model was employed to describe the dynamics of serrated behavior[35]and the serrations were interpreted as avalanches of slipping weak spots in HEAs with different entropies[36]. Generally, we are still far away from the well understanding of the serrated behavior in the compositionally complex but structurally simple alloys. In particular, the mechanism for interactions between diffusing solutes and moving dislocations still remains unclear, especially under tensile condition at wide ranges of both temperature and strain rate.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The aim of the present article was to perform a detailed study on the mechanical properties of the thermomechanically treated CoCrFeNiMn HEA with a comparable grain size. The special focus is placed on the influence of test temperature and strain rate on the serrated flow behavior. Specifically, some interrupted tests are performed for examining the dislocation substructures and the species responsible for DSA are identified by evaluating the activation energies for serrated flow.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"The equiatomic CoCrFeNiMn alloy was produced by vacuum induction melting the constituent elements with at least 99.9 mass% purity under argon atmosphere. The ingots were re-melted five times to ensure chemical homogeneity, and then drop cast into a rectangular steel mold with a dimension of 120×65×10mm3. The drop-cast alloy was homogenized at 1100°C for 24h in vacuum, followed by furnace cooling. They were subsequently cold rolled with a reduction of 40% in thickness using cross-rolling steps to ensure flatness. The rolled sheets were finally recrystallized in air at 900°C for 1h.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"Flat dog boned tensile specimens, 25mm in gauge length and 5.6mm×1.5mm in cross-section were electric-discharge machined and then ground to 2000 grit sand paper to remove surface asperities. Tensile tests at room and high temperatures up to 800°C were carried out at a constant strain rate of 3.0×10−4s−1in air on a CSS-3905 multi-functional testing machine. To examine the effect of strain rate, tensile tests were also conducted at different strain rates ranging from 1.0×10−5s−1to 5.0×10−3s−1. The temperature of a specimen was measured with a temperature accuracy of±1°C by three thermocouples closely attached to the upper, middle and lower section of the specimen, respectively. The tensile strain was continuously measured using a Linear Variable Differential Transducer (LVDT) extensometer having a strain resolution of±0.1µm. The acquisition of time-elongation data was accomplished by a computer and data processing was conducted through a computer program. The tensile yield strength (TYS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and elongation to fracture were averaged over four samples. In particular, several specimens were subjected to interrupted tests with a respective strain of 1% and 20% at RT, 400°C and 600°C. It should be noted that the specimens were rapidly cooled under load using liquid nitrogen to freeze the dislocation structures produced during tensile testing.",[],[]
2,Experimental,The microstructural observation of the as-cast and recrystallized alloys was performed using optical microscopy (OM) (AxioImager. A1m) after etching in an aqueous solution of HCl+H2O2+Cu(NO3)2. The phase constitution was identified by X-ray diffraction (XRD) with Cu-Ka radiation (PANalytical X′pert PRO). Fracture surfaces were examined by a scanning electron microscope (SEM) (XL30 ESEM) operated at 20kV. Thin foils from the interrupted specimens for transmission electron microscope (TEM) observations were twin-jet electropolished in an ethanol solution containing 5% perchloric acid at −25°C and an applied voltage of 35V. TEM investigations were conducted on a JEOL JEM2100F microscope operated at 200kV.,[],[]
3.1,Results.Microstructure," Fig. 1 shows the as-cast and recrystallized optical microstructures of the CoCrFeNiMn alloy. Typical dendritic and interdendritic structures are observed in the as-cast state. After cold rolled and recrystallized, equiaxed grain structures are clearly revealed and many of the grains are observed to contain annealing twins. The average grain size is evaluated to be approximately 25µm. The distinct phase contrast is attributed to the grain crystallographic orientations. Energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) analyses demonstrate that different grains have almost identical elemental compositions. X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns in Fig. 1 c indicated that the equiatomic five-element CoCrFeNiMn alloy consists of a single fcc solid solution phase without precipitates or intermetallic compounds even after tensile at 500°C for 20h.","['f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3.2,Results.Tensile properties and fractograph," Fig. 2 shows the tensile results for the CoCrFeNiMn alloy at a wide test temperature range. As evident from Fig. 2 a, the engineering stress-strain curves exhibit well-defined yield points up to 700°C and failure occurs shortly after the maximum tensile stress is reached. Nevertheless, the sample tested at 800°C reaches its maximum strength quickly and experiences a quite long softening stage accompanied by an obvious necking until final failure. It is worth noting that pronounced serrations are present on the stress-strain curves in the intermediate temperature range of 300–600°C and this striking feature will be addressed in detail in the subsequent sections. As depicted in Fig. 2 b, both the strengths and ductility are strongly temperature-dependent, with their maximum values occurring at room temperature. The yield strength decreases rapidly between RT and 250°C and then gradually down to 82MPa at 800°C. In contrast, the ultimate strength decreases monotonically with increasing temperature and a steep drop emerges between 600 and 800°C. Comparatively, the elongation to fractureεfexhibits much more complicated temperature dependence. The steep drop from room temperature to 250°C is followed by a short plateau-like region between 250 and 550°C. Theεfdrops again sharply to a minimum at 700°C and increases significantly at 800°C due to the large necking plastic strain during the prolonged softening process. In order to evaluate the extent of strain hardening, defined as the difference between the ultimate and yield strengths, the strain hardening exponentnwas calculated through the relationshipσ=kεpn(wherekis the strength coefficient,σandεpare the true stress and true plastic strain, respectively). It is evident from Fig. 2 c that the extent of strain hardening increases slightly to the highest value of 0.42 with increasing temperature up to 500°C. A steep drop then occurs, resulting in almost no strain hardening at 800°C. The large magnitude of strain hardening at the intermediate temperature range might be attributed to the DSA induced serrated flow as indicated by the stress-strain curves.","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0010']",[]
3.2,Results.Tensile properties and fractograph," Fig. 3 shows the representative quasistatic tensile fracture surfaces at different test temperatures. Macroscopically, lack of significant necking is observed up to 700°C owing to the high strain hardening capability which can postpone the onset of necking instability. Microscopically, cohesive tearing facets with several deep equiaxed ductile dimples are observed on the room temperature fracture surface, which indicate a typical ductile mode of failure ( Fig. 3 a). In contrast, such tearing facets vanish and slip band patterns around the dimples become notable at high temperatures ( Figs. 3 b-d), still consistent with a predominant ductile mode of failure. Unfortunately, the fractographs higher than 700℃ are not presented due to the obvious oxidation on the fracture surfaces.","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']",[]
3.3,Results.Serrated flow," Fig. 4 shows the segments of engineering stress-strain curves to demonstrate the evolution of serration type with the test temperature and strain rate. It should be noted that the curves except that of 1×10−5s−1in Fig. 4 b were shifted along the stress axis by an interval of 50MPa for a better view. It is evident from Fig. 4 a that the serrated flow is present within the temperature range of 300–600°C. The type A serration dominates at 300°C, and the serration type changes to A+B at 400°C. As the temperature increases to 500 and 550°C, the serrations evolve into type B and type B+C, respectively. Further increasing temperature to 600°C causes the formation of serration type C. Nevertheless, this type serration exhibits discontinuous characteristic and is observed only in two narrow strain ranges. The early stage appears in a strain range of 0.1–10.5% after the yielding process and the subsequent stage exists in a strain range of 36.5–39% prior to final failure. At temperatures above 600°C, no serrations are observed prior to the final failure as the thermal vibration of atoms is too large to settle down the effective locking of dislocations. As indicated by Fig. 4 c, compared to the effect of temperature on the evolution of serration type, the serration type shows an inverse dependence on strain rate. In other words, the serration type transforms from type A to B and then evolves into a mixed type of B+C or pure type C with decreasing strain rate.","['f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020']",[]
3.3,Results.Serrated flow,"With the purpose of gaining insight into the PLC effect, several related characteristic parameters including the serration amplitude and the critical strain are extracted from the tensile curves in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 . Here, the serration amplitude is the stress difference between the peak stress and the valley stress, and the critical strain reflects the deformation condition for the first occurrence of serration. It is worth noting that a threshold stress for serration is set as 0.5MPa to eliminate the deviation caused by system noise.","['f0010', 'f0020']",[]
3.3,Results.Serrated flow,"The variations of serration amplitude with temperature, strain and strain rate are shown in Fig. 5 where the average serration amplitudes of different serration types are also indicated. In general, almost all the serration amplitudes increase rapidly with the strain upon the first occurrence of serrated flow and gradually reach a saturated value at large strain stage. At a given strain rate of 3×10−4s−1, the type C serration at 600°C has the largest average amplitude (∼6.7MPa, Fig. 5 a). At a given temperature of 500°C, the mixed type of B+C serrations obtained at 1×10−5s−1exhibit the highest intensity level of serrated flow (∼8.9MPa, Fig. 5 b). In view of the interaction between solute atoms and dislocations, once the strain value reaches the critical strain for pinning, the solute atoms can pin the dislocations, and afterwards these pinned dislocations tend to escape from the solute atoms for the occurrence of unpinning process. The number and diffusion velocity of solute atoms vary with deformation, which in return determine the amplitude of serrations. Generally, the serration amplitudeΔσis proportional to the concentration of soluteCsat the dislocation line, that isΔσ∝Cs, and according to the constitutive model of DSA,Cscan be expressed as[37,38].(1)Cs∝cT−1/3D1/3ta1/3wherecis the solute concentration in the matrix,Tis the absolute temperature,D(=D0exp(−Q/RT)withD0being the pre-exponential factors) is the diffusion coefficient,tais the DSA time, during which the solute gathers at the dislocation line, and the index 1/3 denotes the characteristic exponent of pipe diffusion controlled aging kinetics[39]. The aging timeta, equal to the waiting timetw, is related to the elementary strainΩthroughε̇=Ω/tw, andΩ=Ω(ε)is a strain-dependent quantity[40]. Accordingly, the serration amplitude is tightly related to four important parameters including the concentration of solute in the matrix, test temperature, plastic strain and strain rate with complicated nonlinearity.","['f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025']",[]
3.4,Results.Dislocation substructures in deformed samples,"The dislocation substructures in the alloys after deformed at room and high temperatures up to plastic strains of 1% and 20% are presented in Figs. 6  through 8. On the whole, early plastic deformation with low strain except at 600°C produced lower density of dislocations. Instead, higher density dislocations were observed during severe plastic deformation stage. After small plastic deformations at RT and 400°C, quite low density of short parallel dislocation segments were piled up in regions around the grain boundary ( Fig. 6 a and7a). Stacking faults were frequently observed at room temperature ( Fig. 6 b) and individual parallel dislocations were bowed at 400°C ( Fig. 7 b, indicated by arrows) inside grains. Comparatively, the substructures after tested at 600°C revealed clear evidence of a higher density of dislocations piled up at grain boundaries as well as a tangled dislocation network ( Fig. 8 a), kinking/bowing and orderly arranged inside grains ( Fig. 8 b) and forming a hexagonal network owing to dislocation interactions on intersecting planes ( Fig. 8 c).","['f0030', 'f0035', 'f0030', 'f0035', 'f0040', 'f0040', 'f0040', 'f0030', 'f0035', 'f0040']",[]
3.4,Results.Dislocation substructures in deformed samples,"Compared to the early stages of deformation, the microstructures at higher strains (up to plastic strains of 20%) exhibit distinct differences. High density arrays of dislocations were displayed around the grain boundary ( Fig. 6 c and7c) and tangled resulting in the formation of cells inside the grains ( Fig. 6 d and7d) at both RT and 400°C. It can be seen that the dislocation configurations at 600°C were totally different from those developed at lower temperatures, where kinking and bowing of dislocations were clearly visible (indicated by arrows in Fig. 8 d and e) due to pinning of dislocations despite lower dislocation density probably due to thermal recovery.","['f0030', 'f0035', 'f0030', 'f0035', 'f0040']",[]
3.4,Results.Dislocation substructures in deformed samples,"Recent investigations on dislocation substructures in CoCrFeNiMn high entropy alloy[18]and other concentrated fcc solid solutions[41–43]have demonstrated that the early stage of deformation was dominated by the planar slip of 1/2<110>-type dislocations on {111}-type planes. The stacking faults visible in Fig. 6 b resulted from the disassociation of 1/2<110> dislocations into 1/6<112> Shockley partial dislocations and the easy formation of stacking faults was ascribed to the low stacking fault energy of the alloy[44]. The hexagonal dislocation networks present in Fig. 8 c might be associated with the reactions of1/2[1¯1¯0]+1/2[011¯]→1/2[1¯01¯]between dislocations encountering on the same plane[45]and the reacted dislocation lines tended to turn into configurations at an angle of 120° with continuing deformation so as to reach the line tension equilibrium. The observed pile-ups of dislocations would exert a back stress against the grain boundary and thus restrict the movement of dislocations on these slip planes. The transition from planar slip to dislocation cell substructures at high strain resulted from the activation of fresh slip planes to accommodate increasing uncoordinated plasticity, which was caused by dislocation multipoles blocking on the original slip planes[18]. Under such a circumstance, dislocations tended to rearrange into organized cells to release the non-uniform, due to which the work hardening ability was improved. The formation of dislocation kinks and bowing of dislocations via solute pinning revealed strong evidence of the serrated flows. The discontinuity of type C serrations at 3.0×10−4s−1and 600°C can be also interpreted by the formed dislocation substructures, where the pinning state was maintained while the unpinning process was restricted.","['f0030', 'f0040']",[]
4,Discussion,"In order to elucidate the underlying mechanism responsible for serrated flow, the variations of extracted critical plastic strain for the onset of serration with temperatures and strain rates were analyzed as presented in Fig. 9 a and b. The critical plastic strain was found to decrease with increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate, which indicates the occurrence of normal PLC instead of inverse PLC effect. In general, the latter PLC effect is usually marked by an inverse dependence of critical strain onTat higher temperatures or onε̇at lower strain rates. This inverse behavior was tightly associated with either dynamic precipitation during deformation or substitutional-interstitial complexes formed in the early stage of deformation[46]. However, no dynamic precipitation or phase transformation occurred in the present interstitial atom-free CoCrFeNiMn high entropy alloy. Sufficient mobility at higher temperature or prolonged time at lower strain rate could contribute to easier locking of dislocations by solute atoms and led to lower critical strain. Generally, the dependence of critical plastic strain on strain rate (ε̇) and temperature (T) is expressed as[47].(2)εc(m+β)=Kε̇exp(Q/RT)wheremandβare the respective exponents for variations of vacancy concentration (Cv) and mobile dislocation density (ρm) with plastic strain (Cv∝εmandρm∝εβ),Kis a constant,Qis the activation energy for serrated flow,Ris the gas constant, andTis the absolute temperature. Thus, the exponents(m+β)can be determined via evaluating the slope of a plot ofln(ε̇)vsln(εc)at a given temperature, which usually varies from 0.5 to 3 corresponding to different mechanisms responsible for serrated flow[48]. Such a plot was presented in Fig. 10 a and a value of 2.25 for (m+β) at 500°C was obtained, implying that substitutional solutes might be considered as responsible for serrated flow.","['f0045', 'f0050']",[]
4,Discussion,"One method for evaluating activation energy (Q) for serrated flow can be then derived from the solute drag (Cottrell) model-based Eq.(2)asQ=slope×(m+β)×R. It should be noted that this method uses an average value of(m+β)obtained over a range ofε̇andT. Another method is based on the quasi-static aging (McCormick) model, where the critical plastic strain is considered to depend on the concentration of solute as[49].(3)εc(m+β)/T=(ClΦC0)3/2kbLNUmexp(Q/RT)D0ε̇whereC0is the initial concentration of solute in the alloy,Clis the local concentration of solute at the dislocation required for locking,Lis the obstacle spacing,Umis the maximum solute-dislocation interaction energy,D0is the frequency factor,bis the Burger's vector,NandΦare constants. Using Eq.(3),Qcan be evaluated for a givenε̇value from the plot ofln(εc(m+β)/T)vs1/TasQ=slope×R. Specifically, this method allows using individual values of(m+β)for each(ε̇,T)couple. The two plots at a strain rate of 3×10−4s−1were shown in Fig. 10 b and c, respectively. It is apparent that the curves exhibit two regions—Region I with a low activation energy (Q) at temperatures of 300–500°C and Region II with a high activation energy (Q) at temperatures of 500–600°C. In addition, the two methods produce quite little difference in the values of activation energy (Q) in the corresponding regions with average values of 116 and 295kJmol−1for Regions I and II, respectively.",['f0050'],[]
4,Discussion,"In the above two regions, the obtained activation energies should be those for the diffusion of certain solute atoms. Nevertheless, unlike the conventional substitutional solute-containing alloys, there is no dominant matrix element in the present equiatomic HEA and all the constituent elements might get involved in the formation of solute atmosphere around the sliding dislocations, and therefore it is difficult to determine which element is the contributing solute atom. However, recent study has demonstrated that the species and number of diffusing solutes in a series of HEAs with different mixing entropies (low, medium and high) exert a significant influence on the serrated flow behavior[36]. In particular, the temperature range for occurrence of serrated flow can be obviously expanded via addition of other easily diffusing elements. The activation energies for lattice diffusion of the constituent elements in the CoCrFeNiMn alloy are differentiated but quite close[50], for instance, Co (306.9kJmol−1), Cr (292.9kJmol−1), Fe (309.6kJmol−1), Ni (317.5kJmol−1), and Mn (288.4kJmol−1). These values are much higher than the evaluated value in Region I (116kJmol−1). At low temperature range, the species and number of activated solutes are relatively fewer, which can be considered as dilute solute diffusion process. The low value ofQmight be attributed to the strain enhanced diffusion or diffusion through dislocation core (pipe diffusion)[51]. It is well known that the activation energy for pipe diffusion of solute in the conventional substitutional solute-containing alloys takes values around 0.4–0.7 times of the activation energy of lattice diffusion[47,52]. The evaluated activation energy in Region I in the present study is about 0.4 times of values for the lattice diffusion of the constituent elements. Accordingly, it is reasonable to deduce that the pipe diffusion is responsible for the pinning process at low temperature range, which is consistent with the previously reported results in Hastelloy X alloy[51]. It is worth noting that the activation energy in Region II (higher temperature range) is within the narrow activation energy range for diffusion of all five constituent elements (288–317kJmol−1). Considering the difficulty in determining the contributing solute atoms and the additional complication caused by the necessity for cooperative diffusion of constituent atoms in order to have proper composition partitioning, the most sluggish diffusing species, that is Ni, is expected to be rate controlling and dominate the pinning or unpinning process of dislocations. Similar features have been also verified in the high temperature steady state flow and diffusion of equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi high entropy alloys[50,53].",[],[]
5,Conclusion,"The tensile properties and serrated flow have been investigated in the fcc CoCrFeNiMn high entropy alloy with equiaxed medium-grained microstructure. The alloy showed a satisfactory tradeoff between strength and elongation to fracture. Higher strain hardening accompanied by serrated flow characteristic at the intermediate temperature range were notably observed. With increasing temperature and decreasing strain rate, the serration type evolved from type A to B, and finally to type C or B+C and the extracted critical strain decreased. Two activation energiesQfor serrated flow were obtained in different temperature range. In Region I (300–500°C), the solute pinning of dislocations was controlled by pipe diffusion with a value ofQ=116kJmol−1. However, in Region II (500–600°C), a higher value ofQ=296kJmol−1implied that the cooperative lattice diffusion dominated the pinning and unpinning process and the most sluggish species Ni was supposed to be the rate-controlling constituent. Correspondingly, dislocation configurations were dependent on the degree of plasticity and temperature. In particular, high density of dislocations tended to tangle into cells and the frequently observed kinks and bowing of dislocations implied the pinning process by solutes during severe plastic deformation.",[],[]
