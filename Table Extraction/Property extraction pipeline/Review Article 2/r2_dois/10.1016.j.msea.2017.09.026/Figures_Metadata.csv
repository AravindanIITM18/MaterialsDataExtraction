f0005,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2017.09.026/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,(a) EBSD image quality (IQ) map and (b) XRD of initial microstructure.
f0010,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2017.09.026/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,"(a) Tensile stress-strain curve at low and intermediate strain rate, and (b) strain hardening rate curve. CoCrFeMnNi HEA shows higher strength and extended post-elongation at intermediate strain rate without increase in hardening rate."
f0015,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2017.09.026/figures/gr3.jpg,Fig. 3,EBSD image quality (IQ) maps of after 30% deformation at (a) low strain rate and (b) intermediate strain rate.
f0020,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2017.09.026/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,TEM bright-field images of the 30% deformed specimens at (a) low strain rate and (b) and (c) intermediate strain rate. (d) is dark-field image of same area with (c). Planar and wavy slip had occurred at low strain rate. Stacking faults and deformation twins were observed at intermediate strain rate.
f0025,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2017.09.026/figures/gr5.jpg,Fig. 5,(a) Digital images of strain distribution at initial and final stage of intermediate strain rate deformation. (b) local strain distribution curve of deformation localized region that marked by black dashed rectangle in (a).
f0030,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2017.09.026/figures/gr6.jpg,Fig. 6,SEM micrograph of the transverse section beneath the fracture surface of fractured specimen at the intermediate strain rate. The voids were observed.
