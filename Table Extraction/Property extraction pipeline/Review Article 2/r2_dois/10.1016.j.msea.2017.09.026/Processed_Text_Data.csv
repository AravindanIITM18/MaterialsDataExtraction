0,Abstract,The intermediate strain rate tensile behaviors of a CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy were investigated. Dislocation slips combined with deformation twinning dominated the initial stage of deformation. A phonon drag mechanism became evident after necking; this extended post-elongation gave rise to a ductility superior to that displayed at a static strain rate.,[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs) have recently come into the spotlight due to their excellent properties, such as high strength[1,2], good wear resistance[3], corrosion resistance[4], and thermal stability[5]. Additionally, HEAs have the potential for further undiscovered properties due to cocktail effects[6]. The CoCrFeMnNi HEA, in particular, has been actively researched because of its good cryogenic properties, attributed to deformation twinning, and is expected to have cryogenic applications[7–10]. For HEAs to be practically applied, it is necessary to understand their deformation behaviors in the intermediate strain rate range of 1s−1to 500s−1, i.e. the strain rates required for high-speed forming processes such as stamping[11]. However, few studies have been carried out on the deformation behavior of HEAs at an intermediate strain rate. In this work, an intermediate strain rate tensile test was performed on the CoCrFeMnNi HEA. The deformation behavior was investigated in the pre-necking region and post-necking region through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and digital image correlation (DIC) analysis, respectively.",[],[]
2,Experiment,"A CoCrFeMnNi HEA was prepared by vacuum induction melting (VIM) using high-purity elements. The ingot was homogenized at 1200°C for 24h, and rolled at 700°C with a reduction ratio of 93% (< 10% /pass). The slight edge cracks in the hot-rolled HEA sheet were eliminated by machining. The HEA was rolled at room temperature until it acquired a thickness of 1.35mm. It was then annealed at 900°C for 30min, and cooled in air.",[],[]
2,Experiment,"The CoCrFeMnNi HEA was mechanically polished and electro-etched in a solution of 8% HClO4and 92% CH3COOH. Electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD, acceleration voltage 15kV, step size: 0.1µm) analysis was conducted using an FE-SEM (model: SU-6600, HITACHI) equipped with an EDAX-TSL OIMTM data collection system. Disk specimens of 3mm were electro-polished by a twin-jet polisher (model: Tenupol-5, Struers, Denmark) in the same solution (8% HClO4and 92% CH3COOH) for TEM analysis. Microstructures were observed by TEM (model: JEM 2100, JEOL).",[],[]
2,Experiment,"Plate-type tensile specimens (gage length: 25mm, gage width: 6mm, thickness: 1.35mm) for low strain rate (LSR) tensile tests were prepared along the rolling direction. These were tested at a strain rate of 0.001s−1by a universal testing machine (model: Instron 5982). For the intermediate strain rate (ISR) tensile tests, plate-type tensile specimens (gage length: 32mm, gage width: 6mm, thickness: 1.35mm) were prepared along the rolling direction, and tested at a strain rate of 100s−1by a high-speed material testing machine (model: Instron VHS-65/80-25). Photographs of the tensile specimen surface during the ISR tensile test were taken using a high-speed camera (model: Photron SA-X2) to analyze the local deformation strain during the tensile test. The high-speed camera snapped 100,000 images per second. The testing procedures have been described in detail in previous papers[12,13].",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties and hardening behavior," Fig. 1(a)  shows the initial microstructure of the wrought CoCrFeMnNi HEA alloy, in which a completely recrystallized microstructure and many annealing twins can be seen. The average grain size is 9.8µm and it consists of a single fcc phase ( Fig. 1(b) ). Fig. 2 and Table 1 show the tensile properties under a LSR (0.001s−1) and ISR (100s−1). As the strain rate increases, the yield strength also increases from 484MPa to 650MPa, while the tensile strength increases from 853MPa to 968MPa. An improved total elongation can be observed, despite the decrease in uniform elongation, due to the large post-elongation of the ISR specimen (20%).","['f0005', 'f0005', 'f0010']",['t0005']
3.1,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties and hardening behavior,"In general, the strengths of fcc metals are relatively less sensitive to the strain rate[14,15]. However, this HEA displays a larger increase in strength at the early stage of the deformation. To understand the reason behind this, we examined the microstructural differences between the samples tested under LSR and ISR. It was difficult to stop the ISR tensile test in the middle of the deformation process due to limitations of the high-speed material testing machine; hence, a fractured specimen was prepared to observe the microstructure under ISR. It was assumed that the non-necking region of fractured ISR specimen was around 30% which is correspond to the uniform elongation. A strain of 30% for the LSR test was achieved by interrupted tensile testing.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties and hardening behavior," Fig. 3(a)  and (b) show the EBSD image quality (IQ) maps of the HEAs after 30% deformation. The LSR specimen shows thick annealing twins, which were present in the initial microstructure, without deformation twins. In contrast, the IQ map of the ISR specimen shows many narrow deformation twins. To verify the existence of the deformation twins, TEM analysis was conducted. Fig. 4(a)  through (d) show the TEM micrographs for the LSR and ISR specimens at a strain of 30%. From the LSR tensile test, it can be clearly observed that deformation takes place primarily by a dislocation slip mechanism ( Fig. 4(a) ). Planar as well as wavy slips have occurred, and the planar dislocations are aligned along the (1−11) slip planes, as indicated by the dotted lines in Fig. 4(a) . The ISR specimen shows streaked diffraction spots resulting from stacking faults that are formed by partial dislocations in fcc materials[16,17], which are regarded as a precursor to twinning. In other grains, deformation twins can be seen ( Fig. 4(c)  and (d)). The deformation mechanisms of fcc materials are related to their stacking fault energies[18], and those of the HEAs have been widely reported[19,20]. However, there are a few studies on the deformation behavior of HEAs at high strain rates[21,22]. As opposed to the results of A. Gali et al., who found that CoCrFeMnNi HEAs exhibit a weak strain-rate dependence[21], we observed a significant increase in the strength for an ISR. This is because higher strain rates affect the critical stresses for slip and twinning. In fcc metals, it is well-established that the stress required for twinning is less sensitive to the strain rate than that for slip[23]. The critical stress for twinning in the CoCrFeMnNi HEA is about 720MPa[19], which was reached right after yielding at the ISR. Previous research was focused on strain rates of 0.001s−1to 0.1s−1, which is why the strength of the CoCrFeMnNi HEA previously displayed a weak strain-rate dependence. At a strain rate of 100s−1, the transition of the deformation mechanism from a dislocation slip to a mixed mode of dislocation slip and twinning, as well as a higher dislocation density[24], leads to an increase in strength.","['f0015', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020']",[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties and hardening behavior,"Even when deformation twinning has occurred, the strain hardening rate for the ISR specimen was almost the same as that of the LSR specimen ( Fig. 2(b) ). The following are possible factors that could explain this unusual behavior:(i)A. Eisenlohr et al. found that local adiabatic heating occurs near twins[25]. Due to the short time allowed for heat dissipation during the ISR test, local adiabatic heating could have affect the dislocation motion even in the early stages of deformation, leading to a reduction in the hardening rate.(ii)The high friction stress of HEAs induced by lattice distortion[26], could cause higher temperature increases during the deformation than for in other materials. Additionally, the relatively low heat capacity of CoCrFeMnNi HEAs, 430J/kgK[27], could lead to increased adiabatic heating and a reduced hardening rate.",['f0010'],[]

3.2,Results and discussion.Post-necking behavior,"Post-elongation is related to the toughness of materials[28], and post-necking properties are required to understand metal forming processes which generate strains beyond uniform elongation (e.g. clinch forming, stamping and deep drawing)[29]. Despite the importance of post-elongation, post-necking behavior at intermediate strain rates is rarely reported. In a stress-strain curve, the pre- and post-region of necking can be classified into the n-effect region and m-effect region, respectively, where n is the strain hardening coefficient and m is the strain rate sensitivity[30]. Materials that have small m-values exhibit insufficient strain rate hardening even in the localized deformation region, and rapidly soften after necking; hence, they have short post-elongation. It is well known that fcc metals have small m-values and tend to reach failure right after maximum strength[31]. However, this CoCrFeMnNi HEA shows exceptional post-elongation of about 20% at the ISR. Several TWIP steels have shown similar extended post-elongation at a high strain rate tensile deformation by split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB)[32]. Park et al. found that this extended post-necking is due to adiabatic heating at the high strain rate deformation[32]. The ISR tensile test, however, results in a smaller heat increase than in the SHPB tests, as there is more time for heat dissipation during the test. Its excellent post-necking properties could be explained not only by the effects of adiabatic heating, but also by the transition of the dislocation motion mechanism. Fig. 5 shows the DIC analysis results of the localized deformation region of the ISR after necking. Fig. 5(a)  shows the strain distribution at the initial and final stages of the ISR test. After necking, the deformation is localized and the localized deformation region appears as a yellow or red color in the figure. The local strains at the localized deformation region after necking, calculated as distances from the fractured position from digital images taken along the center line, are plotted in Fig. 5(b) . The numbers refer to the image order, which provides information about the time periods. From #589 to #629, took 41μs, since each image was taken as 100,000 fps. The maximum and average strain rates at the localized deformation region calculated from Fig. 5(b)  are 6883s−1and 3768s−1, respectively, although the global strain rate is 100s−1. K. Sakino et al. reported that the m-value of fcc metals increases dramatically when the strain rate exceeds about 3000s−1[33]. This could be due to the transition of the dislocation motion mechanism from a thermally activated dislocation movement to phonon viscosity drag[33]. The net force of the lattice vibration energy, the phonon energy, acts in a direction opposite to the dislocation movement[34]. This hinders dislocation movement and consequently, the strain rate sensitivity increases as the strain rate increases. During the ISR tensile test, the strain rate after necking exceeded the 3000s−1benchmark suggested by Sakino, implying that the phonon viscosity drag becomes the dominant mechanism after necking, increasing the strain rate sensitivity and post-elongation.","['f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025', 'f0025']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Post-necking behavior,"Meanwhile, Abbasi et al. reported that short post-elongation during tensile tests are potentially caused by the sudden intensive nucleation and growth of secondary voids[31]. Fig. 6 shows the transverse section of the ISR specimen beneath the fracture surface. The voids can be observed clearly in the neck of the specimen. The void formation mechanism of low stacking fault energy materials, such as CoCrFeMnNi HEAs, can be explained by two stages: i) the formation of vacancies at the intersections of stacking faults, and ii) the formation of voids by the emission of dislocations[35]. Emission of dislocations is also resisted by the phonon energy, and it can prolong the post-elongation of the materials when the strain rate is high enough. In the case of high stacking fault energy materials, created dislocations are mostly perfect, and so emission of dislocations creates point defects or micro-cracks instead of voids[35], meaning these materials are less sensitive to phonon effects. This is the difference between low and high stacking fault energy materials. Under the influence of adiabatic heating and phonon effects, the CoCrFeMnNi HEA shows extended post-elongation and excellent tensile properties in the ISR range.",['f0030'],[]
4,Conclusion,"In summary, the CoCrFeMnNi HEA has great strength and elongation at an intermediate strain rate due to the following mechanisms. In the pre-necking region of the intermediate strain rate tensile test, deformation twinning had occurred; however, there was no distinct increase in the hardening rate. In the post-necking region, extended post-elongation was gained due to adiabatic heating and a high strain rate of over 3000s−1at the localized deformation region, which leads to phonon viscosity drag as a dislocation motion mechanism.",[],[]
