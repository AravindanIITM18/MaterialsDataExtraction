f0005,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2016.12.110/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,(a) The optical microscopy image and (b) XRD pattern of the Al0.1CoCrFeNi high entropy alloy. The inset shows the dimensions of tensile specimens.
f0010,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2016.12.110/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,"TEM micrograph and diffraction pattern of as-prepared Al0.1CoCrFeNi. The electron beam is along the [110] zone axis. The red arrows in (b) indicate the stack faults. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)"
f0015,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2016.12.110/figures/gr3.jpg,Fig. 3,Engineering stress–strain curves of the Al0.1CoCrFeNi alloy at the four testing temperatures. The inset shows the platform region after yielding for the Al0.1CoCrFeNi alloy that was tested at 25°C.
f0020,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2016.12.110/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,"Temperature dependence of (a) 0.2% offset yield stress, ultimate tensile strength, and (b) elongation to fracture."
f0025,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2016.12.110/figures/gr5.jpg,Fig. 5,"The microstructures of high entropy alloy, Al0.1CoCrFeNi, tested at different temperatures: (a) 25°C; (b) 500°C; (c) 600°C; (d) 700°C. The inset in (a) shows the {111}-type slip plane. Due to the high strain, several slip systems are activated, and dislocations with different Burgers vectors can be found, but 1/2〈110〉-type dislocation on {111}-type planes is more than the others. The white arrows in (c) indicate the stacking faults and the inset shows the corresponding high resolution image of stacking faults."
f0030,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2016.12.110/figures/gr6.jpg,Fig. 6,"(a) Temperature dependence of the degree of work hardening in the Al0.1CoCrFeNi alloy (the difference between the ultimate and yield strengths, σu-σy), (b) Work hardening rate (derivative of the true stress–true strain curves) depicted as a function of the true stress for the Al0.1CoCrFeNi alloy tested at different temperatures. The grey area is the geometric instability region (necking) according to Considere's criterion (the work hardening rate is less than the true stress)."
f0035,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2016.12.110/figures/gr7.jpg,Fig. 7,(a) Dissociated dislocations and (b) stacking fault fringes observed in the Al0.1CoCrFeNi alloy deformed at 700°C.
f0040,articles_test/10.1016.j.msea.2016.12.110/figures/gr8.jpg,Fig. 8,"The engineering stress-strain curves at 500, 600, and 700°C. The arrows indicate some yield drops that occur below the general level of the flow curve, which are the characterization of Type C serration and cannot be observed at 25 and 500°C. The inset shows the wide stacking fault formed at 700°C."
