0,Abstract,"Often the experimentally-observed, single-phase high entropy alloy (HEA) is the result of second-phase precipitation constrained by thermodynamic and kinetic factors. Using Al0.3CoCrFeNi as a candidate HEA, this paper demonstrates the strong influence of thermo-mechanical processing on the transformation pathway adopted for isothermal second-phase precipitation. A traditional thermo-mechanical processing route comprised of homogenization cold-rolling solution treatment in the single fcc phase region, followed by a precipitation anneal at a lower temperature, results in a homogeneous distribution of nanometer scale-ordered L12 (gamma prime-like) precipitates within the fcc matrix. In contrast, if cold-rolling is followed directly by annealing at the precipitation temperature, then the resulting microstructural evolution pathway changes completely, with concurrent recrystallization of the matrix fcc grains and precipitation of B2 and sigma phases, largely at the grain boundaries. These experimentally observed variations in transformation pathway have been rationalized via the competition between the thermodynamic driving force and activation barrier for second-phase nucleation in this alloy, coupled with the kinetics of the process. The microstructural variations that result from these dramatically different phase transformation pathways can lead to some rather exceptional mechanical properties that can be varied over a large range even for a single Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA composition.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High Entropy Alloys (HEAs) are an intriguing new class of metallic materials that offer a versatile range of permutations of composition and phase structures with a wide range of structure-property combinations [1–10]. This new class of alloys derives their properties from being multi-element systems, and can crystallize as simple phase structures despite high concentrations of five or more elements [2–10].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Researcher fascination with HEAs is concentrated on their many superior mechanical and physical properties, some of which are more attractive than commercially-optimized and -used alloys. For example, ultrahigh fracture toughness of somefcc-based HEAs is comparable to cryogenic steel [11–13], significant resistance to fatigue [9,14], oxidation [15,16] and corrosion in various environments [17–21]; extremely good irradiation resistance [22–24]; large strain hardenability [25–27]; superconductivity [28]; magnetic properties [29–32]; high-temperature strength and toughness [33–36]; and chemical properties [37]. The literature often debates whether the superior properties of HEAs are direct consequences of four core effects; i.e., high entropy, sluggish diffusion, severe lattice distortion and cocktail effect [38–40]. Due to competition between enthalpy and entropy, these systems should be dealt individually and generalizing any one rule on all these alloys might not be possible or scientifically correct all the time.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Instead, in general, the rich compositional variability of HEAs means they offer tremendous opportunities to micro-engineer the microstructure and manipulate the resultant properties. Several different mechanisms governing the final properties can be activated at the same time in these alloys to attain a cumulative effect on the resultant property. The major concern forfcc-based alloys is the lower strength as compared to bcc-based materials. Also, many researchers have critically assessedfccHEAs being similar to multi-component austenitic stainless steels or Ni-based super-alloys, which are often composed of more than two major alloy elements; for example, commercial alloys INCONEL 800 (Cr23Fe46Ni31), INCONEL 600 (Ni74Cr18Fe8), and SS 316 (Cr18Fe67Mn2Mo1Ni12). Most of the reported mechanical strength data onfccHEAs suggest strength very similar to that of commercially-used austenitic stainless steels (yield strength = 250–500 MPa and elongation to failure = 5–30%) [6,8–10,12,25,26,38–42]. Ni-based alloys provide even higher strength and stability in a wider range of temperatures extending to 900–1000 °C [43]. Some precipitation-strengthened stainless steels like PH-17-4 or PH 13-8 offer exceptional room temperature ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of >1.4 GPa. PH steels have an austenitic matrix under solutionized condition (UTS = <700 MPa), but are used mostly after a thermal treatment that induces martensitic transformation along with fine-scale precipitation, which improves strength tremendously. Also, commercial alloys represent exhaustive research and experience to satisfy an exquisite balance of requirements that go far beyond first- and second-tier properties. The minor additions of interstitial elements, focused heat treatment cycles and standardized manufacturing routes have been established to fine-tune the properties that match the requirements for all commercial alloys.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"HEAs offer tremendous potential, and identifying the right candidate for coherent applications is important for further development of the alloy. Precipitates and refined grain structure both add to improving material strength.Fcc-based Al0.3CoCrFeNi (a quinary HEA) has successfully demonstrated the potential to be precipitation-strengthened via ordered phases [12,27,44–47]; it also showed a strong capability for grain boundary strengthening [47]. The addition of Ti, Mo, Nb in CoCrFeNi (quaternary alloy) and Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy systems has further strengthened the alloy at room temperature by forming strong precipitate phases [48–55]. The Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy displayed high yield strength of 1600 MPa in fiber form at 77 K [12] and shows good radiation resistance up to 60 peak dpa [23]. The alloy exhibits remarkable resistance to shear localization and is a potential candidate for penetration protection applications such as armors [56,57]. Room-temperature strength of the alloy reported so far has been rather low (∼300 MPa) [27,58], whereas corrosion resistance was reported to be better than SS 304 and SS 316 [19]. The unique combination of various elements like Al for precipitation strengthening, Cr for corrosion resistance, Ni for strength and creep resistance, and Co for superior creep resistance makes this alloy a perfect candidate for applications such as structural material in pressure water reactors, and in nuclear powers plants if material strength could be improved.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In the current work we used different processing routes to examine the possible phases in anfcc-based HEA (Al0.3CoCrFeNi). The processing history not only influenced the precipitation sequence, precipitate type, size scale and distribution but also provided a range of strength-ductility combinations in the same composition. This work compares strengthening by incoherent/semi-coherent phase precipitation with strengthening by coherent precipitates using the same composition. Varying the inherent strain in the system in the form of defects, dislocations and deformation bands can change the precipitation sequence and result in drastic engineering of the microstructure.",[],[]
2.1,Experimental methods.Materials processing,"HEA of composition Al0.3CoCrFeNi was obtained from Sophisticated Alloys Inc. The as-received alloy was homogenized at 1150 °C for 10 h. Previous microstructural assessment of the alloy confirmed that the alloy has a single-phasefcccrystal structure above ∼1100 °C [47]. The homogenized alloy was cold-rolled at room temperature for 90% reduction in thickness and subsequently cut into several slabs. Two different processing routes were followed to process the alloy further (Fig. 1). The first route consisted of solutionizing the alloy at high temperature (1150 °C for 2 min) to recrystallize the alloy, followed by annealing at a lower temperature of 620 °C for 50 h. It has been previously established that this alloy composition can be precipitation-strengthened by coherent L12(orderedfccintermetallic) [47]. The second route aimed at achieving concurrent recrystallization and precipitation at low temperature. Hence the separate recrystallization step at 1150 °C was not done; instead, the cold-rolled slab was aged directly at 620 °C for 50 h. The microstructural details from heat treatments are discussed in the following sections.",['fig1'],[]
2.2,Experimental methods.Microstructural characterization,"To analyze the microstructure of the material after processing, pieces were cut and metallographically polished in stages. Final mirror surface finish was achieved by 0.02 μm colloidal silica gel VibroMet™ polishing. The crystal orientations and elemental composition were characterized by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), respectively, in a FEI Nova Nano scanning electron microscope (SEM). Lift-out samples for Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and atom probe tomography (APT) were prepared using an FEI Nova 200 dual beam focused ion beam (FIB). TEM analysis was conducted using an FEI Tecnai F20 operated at 200 kV fitted with a STEM-EDS detector. APT experiments were conducted on a CAMECA local electrode atom probe 3000× HR instrument. All experiments were performed in the temperature range of 40–50 K with target evaporation of 0.5% and pulse fraction of 20% of a steady-state applied DC voltage. APT data reconstruction and analysis were carried out using CAMECA IVAS® 3.6.10 software.",[],[]
2.3,Experimental methods.Synchrotron x-ray diffraction,"Samples forin situsynchrotron studies were prepared with dimensions of 5 mm × 5 mm × 0.5 mm (thickness). The experiment was carried out at the 11-IDC beam-line (111 keV, l ¼ 0.117418 Å) of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). A CeO2standard (NIST diffraction intensity standard set: 674a) was used to calibrate the distance between and among the samples and the 2D detector, the position of the beam center and the detector tilt angle. The high energy of the synchrotron beam at APS permitted carrying out the XRD experiments in the transmission mode through relatively thick samples, and led to averaging over substantial sample volumes. The samples were rocked from ±5°, with a square beam of 500 × 500 μm2and sample thickness ∼1000 μm. With an average grain size of ∼20 μm, {(500 × 500 × 1000)/(20)3} ∼31000 grains were included in the study. The scattered radiation was collected on a Perkin Elmer 2D detector system. Fit-2D software was used to radially integrate the 2D diffraction data to produce 1D intensity vs. two-theta (2θ) plots. The resulting 1D diffraction data were analyzed using the Pawley method [59], as embodied in TOPAS software (Bruker), to obtain accurate measurements of the lattice parameters for the two phases as a function of temperature.",[],[]
2.4,Experimental methods.Mechanical characterization,"Dog-bone-shaped tensile specimens with gauge length 3 mm were machined from the rolled and annealed sheets by Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM). Both sides of the specimen were ground using SiC paper to achieve final thickness of ∼0.7 mm and gauge width of ∼1.0 mm. Tensile tests were performed at an engineering strain rate of 10−3s−1. Each test was performed at least three times to ensure consistency; representative results are reported herein. These quasi-static tests used a LVDT (Linear Variable Displacement Transformer) extensometer to perform at least four independent tests to obtain tensile elongation and strength data. The elongation of the gauge length of each sample was measured after testing, and engineering stress–strain curves were calculated from the load-displacement data. Yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, and elongation to failure were determined from the uniaxial tensile stress–strain curves.",[],[]
2.5,Experimental methods.Nomenclature,"the four conditions discussed in detail in this report are 90% cold rolled (cr), 90% cold rolled + solutionized at 1150°c/2 mins (crsa), 90% cold rolled + solutionized at 1150°c/2 mins + annealed at 620°c/50h (crsa-620) and 90% cold rolled + directly annealed at 620°c/50h (cr-620).",[],[]
3.1.1,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.Cold-rolled microstructure,"The first step in homogenizing the cast Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy was annealing at 1150 °C for 10 h. The alloy was then cold-rolled (CR) to 90% reduction in thickness. The SEM micrograph and orientation map from the CR condition presented inFig. 2include a low magnification back scattered electron diffraction (BSED) image (Fig. 2(a)) that shows the severely strained and elongatedfccgrains after cold rolling. The inverse pole figure (IPF) map from a representative region, highlighted in the BSED image using a white box inFig. 2(a), isFig. 2(b). This region is located within a single priorfccgrain of the parent solution-treated microstructure, and exhibits a high degree of local misorientation, presumably resulting from high dislocation density and the rearrangement of these dislocations into cells and sub-cells as well as the formation of deformation twins (Fig. 2(c). Furthermore, the black arrows inFig. 2(b) mark regions at these deformation twin/dislocation cell boundaries, with clear evidence of newly recrystallized fine-scalefccgrains forming within the strained prior larger-scalefccmatrix grains. Formation of these recrystallized regions within the strainedfccmatrix grains indicates that severe cold-rolling to 90% not only results in a high density of dislocations, but also that local adiabatic heating in some regions results in initiation of recrystallization. Additionally, deformation twins are also seen in the 90% cold-rolled microstructure, an example of which is shown inFig. 2(c). A misorientation profile along the vector shown by a yellow arrow inFig. 2(c) is shown as the inset. Misorientation profiling along the highlighted lines confirmed the bands in the IPF map to be twin fault planes with their characteristic 60° misorientation.","['fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2']",[]
3.1.1,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.Cold-rolled microstructure,"TEM is perfomed on the 90% cold rolled (CR) condition and the results are shown inFig. 2(d).Fig. 2(d) shows a low magnification bright field (BF) TEM image. SADPs from [001] and [11¯2¯] zone axes are shown as insets in left bottom and right top respectively. The absence of super lattice spots, or any other additional spots, indicates that no ordering/precipitation of second phase(s) occurs as a result of cold rolling. A high magnification view of the region marked by the white dotted box inFig. 2(d) is shown inFig. 2(e). Deformation bands are clearly observed in this microstructure, arranged in a somewhat periodic manner, and the boundaries of these bands have been previously considered to be geometrically necessary boundaries (GNBs) [60], aligning parallel to the rolling direction (seeFig. 2(c) and (d)). Additionally, fine scale deformation twinning is observed within these macroscopic deformation bands. A selected area diffraction pattern (SADP), recorded from a [011]fcczone axis, is shown as an inset to the figure, where the twin plane is marked by yellow dotted line. The primary reflections of thefcc-matrix/twin are related by a mirror symmetry about the dotted straight line joining the higher and lower order (1¯11) reflections. The nano-twins in the lamellar microstructures suggests the transition from dislocation slip dominated, to a twinning-dominated deformation mechanism especially in heavily cold rolling.","['fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2', 'fig2']",[]
3.1.1,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.Cold-rolled microstructure,"Regardless, the severe cold work resulted in a substantially high degree of stored strain energy in thefccmatrix, eventually leading to recrystallization, accompanied by the formation of fine-scale new grains in the microstructure during isothermal annealing at 1150 °C, as discussed in the subsequent section.",[],[]
3.1.2,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.Recrystallization at high temperature in single fcc phase region,"A second annealing treatment at 1150 °C for 2 min after cold-rolling resulted in complete recrystallization of the microstructure. The microstructural characterization results from cold-rolled plus solution annealed (CRSA) condition are shown inFig. 3. BSED SEM image from this condition presents an abundance of annealing twins that depict a strain-free and relaxed structure with grain size of ∼20 μm (Fig. 3(a)). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results confirm that selected area diffraction pattern (SADP) from [011]fcczone axis clearly established a single-phasefccstructure (Fig. 3(b)).","['fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3']",[]
3.1.2,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.Recrystallization at high temperature in single fcc phase region,"The atom probe reconstruction from the intra-granular region is shown inFig. 3(c). All ions appear in the reconstruction, and no partitioning of the element is evident. Hence, the CRSA condition consists of single-phasefccstructure with no fine-scale decomposition or second-phase precipitation.",['fig3'],[]
3.1.3,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.Phase separation followed by ordering transformation (precipitation of ordered L12s phase) on low-temperature aging,"Figs. 4–6show TEM results from the CRSA-620 condition, after isothermal annealing of the fully recrystallized sample at 620 °C for 50 h. Two types of [001]fcczone axis SADP patterns, shown inFig. 4(a) and (b), were recorded from this sample, from two different regions. While the majority of regions exhibited the pattern shown inFig. 4(a), a smaller fraction of regions exhibited the pattern shown inFig. 4(b).Fig. 4(a) clearly shows extra super-lattice spots at {100} and {110} locations, indicating the possible presence of an L12phase. Additionally,Fig. 4(c) shows the [011]fcczone axis (ZA) from the same region of the sample, with extra {100} and {110} super-lattice reflections, confirming the presence of the L12phase. A dark-field TEM image recorded from a {001} type superlattice reflection (marked by a circle inFig. 4(a)), clearly reveals these L12precipitates within thefccmatrix. Interestingly, the [001]fcczone axis SADP shown inFig. 4(b), revealed additional super-lattice reflections, beyond the {100} and {110} type L12reflections. These principal additional super-lattice reflections are located at 1/8{220} locations, as seen inFig. 4(b). Additional SADP patterns, corresponding to the [112]fccand the [111]fcczone axes are shown inFig. 5(a) and (b) respectively. These diffraction patterns also reveal both super-lattice reflections corresponding to the L12phase, as well as the new ordered phase leading to the 1/8{220} reflections. Further analysis of this new ordered phase has been carried out via preliminary high-resolution TEM investigations, shown inFig. 6. Both high-resolution TEM images, shown inFig. 6(a) and (c), have been recorded along the [001]fccviewing direction. An example of an interface between the fcc matrix and a L12precipitate is shown inFig. 6(a) with the corresponding fourier transform, shown inFig. 6(b). The L12ordering is clearly visible in this high-resolution TEM image.Fig. 6(c) shows a high-resolution TEM image from a precipitate of the second ordered phase with the corresponding fourier transform shown inFig. 6(d). The atomic-resolution image of this ordered phase reveals that the repeat unit cell for this structure consists of eight consecutive {220}fcclattice planes, as marked by the dashed box inFig. 6(c). Such a repeat unit cell will lead to the 1/8{220} reflections observed in the [001]fccSADP patterns. The details of the crystal structure, symmetry, and lattice parameters of this new ordered phase in the CRSA-620 condition have not yet been determined, and constitute part of future studies. Nevertheless, the results presented in this paper do establish the presence of a second new ordered precipitate, beyond the L12precipitates. However, the majority precipitates appear to be L12precipitates with only a small fraction of precipitates belonging to the new ordered phase.","['fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig5', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig4', 'fig5', 'fig6']",[]
3.1.3,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.Phase separation followed by ordering transformation (precipitation of ordered L12s phase) on low-temperature aging,"Compositional analysis of the precipitates in the CRSA-620 condition has been carried out using energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), using a Super EDS detector (Chemi-STEM technique) in an aberration-corrected TITAN TEM. The results as presented inFig. 7include the following: (a) the HAADF-STEM image from an intra-granular region where the precipitates exhibit a darker contrast; while (b-f) show the compositional maps of the various elements as respectively marked in the figure. The precipitates are rich in Al and Ni and lean in all other elements (Cr, Fe and Co). Based on these Chemi-STEM results from the precipitates, it appears that all samples precipitates have similar compositions. Therefore, it is not possible to distinguish between the L12precipitates and the precipitates of the new ordered phase, based on this composition analysis. This suggests that the two types of precipitates are quite similar in composition.",['fig7'],[]
3.1.3,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.Phase separation followed by ordering transformation (precipitation of ordered L12s phase) on low-temperature aging,"Atom probe tomography (APT) results from CRSA-620 condition are shown inFig. 8.Fig. 8(a) shows an ionic/atomic APT reconstruction of this sample, together with a section of a dark-field TEM image. The similarity between the size scale and morphology of the precipitates between these two renditions, establishes the fidelity of the atom probe reconstruction. The APT reconstruction inFig. 8(a) shows all the ions/atoms in the sample.Fig. 8(b) delineates the precipitates in the APT reconstruction, using a 15% Al iso-concentration surface, together with nickel ions plotted in the same reconstruction. Compositional profiles across the interface between thefccmatrix and precipitates (Fig. 8(c)) confirm that the precipitates are enriched in Al and Ni, consistent with the Chemi-STEM results. Again, it appears that there is no significant difference between the compositions of these precipitates, captured within the APT reconstruction volume. Therefore, at this point it is not possible to compositionally distinguish the L12 precipitates from the precipitates of the new ordered phase. The compositions of the L12andfccphase in atomic percent from APT analysis are shown inTable 1.","['fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8', 'fig8']",['tbl1']
3.1.4,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.In situ investigation of order-disorder reaction via synchrotron XRD,The results of synchrotron diffraction experiments carried out duringin situheating and cooling are summarized in the XRD plots inFig. 9. The starting condition for thesein situheating-cooling synchrotron experiments was a CRSA-620 sample that contained well-developed L12precipitates prior to initiation of the heating cycle at the synchrotron.,['fig9'],[]
3.1.4,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.In situ investigation of order-disorder reaction via synchrotron XRD,"The rate of heating and cooling was controlled at 0.5 °C/s. X-ray data were collected throughout the experiment at 18s or 9 °C intervals. The maximum temperature of heating was 1000 °C, where the sample was held for 30 min. A few selected plots inFig. 9show where the fundamentalfcc({111} and {200}) reflections have been plotted in a staggered plot. While heating, the data in the figure were recorded at 50 °C (Black color), 650 °C (Green color), and 900 °C (Red color); and while cooling, the data are recorded at 50 °C (Blue color). The insets on the left of the figure (the magnified views), clearly reveal the L12peaks at 50 °C and 650 °C during heating. The {100} and {110} L12peaks are labeled in the figures for these two conditions. The L12peaks do not appear when the temperature rises (inset on left showing the magnified view of XRD trace in red color, recorded at 900 °C); and while it cools (inset on right showing the magnified view of XRD trace in blue color, recorded at 50 °C). Additionally, an interesting note is the evidence of lattice expansion when comparing initial condition and later condition, where the L12phase has dissolved. Cahn [61], has examined the lattice parameter changes accompanying order-disorder transformations in several intermetallic phases with a variety of crystal structures. He concluded “the lattice parameter changes are correlated much more closely with the ordering energy than with the mismatch of atomic sizes”. In our system where elements like Ni, Co, Fe and Al have strong tendencies to form unlike bonds accompanied by exothermic energy release, it can assumed that the ordering energy plays the dominant role in formation of the ordered precipitates. This will result in shorter bond lengths and thus reduce average lattice parameter of the matrix as compared to the fully disorderedfccmatrix. Such lattice expansion, due to an order-disorder transformation within the matrix, has been reported in Ni-base super alloys [62].",['fig9'],[]
3.1.4,Results.Precipitation in fully-recrystallized fcc microstructure.In situ investigation of order-disorder reaction via synchrotron XRD,"The experimentally measured lattice constant from the majorfccdiffraction peaks in this case correspond to an average effect of the ordered domains and the surrounding disordered matrix. In the present study, the matrix lattice constants were determined accurately using Rietveld refinement of the synchrotron XRD patterns obtained duringin situannealing experiments. Lattice constants were determined from selected data points along the heating and cooling cycles, and are plotted as a function of temperature (Fig. 10). At the early stages of the heating cycle, the lattice expanded linearly due to thermal expansion; but above ∼670 °C, there is a change in the slope with the rate of expansion increasing substantially. The change in the slope or the change in the rate of expansion while heating can be attributed to the order-disorder transition in this alloy, as is clear fromFig. 10. Thisin situheating-cooling cycle, carried out in the synchrotron, resulted in disordering of the ordered alloy; and this disordered random solid solution is retained on cooling to ambient temperature. Furthermore, the lattice parameters of the individual phases:fccand L12were calculated to be 3.591 ± 0.002 and 3.596 ± 0.002 Å.","['fig10', 'fig10']",[]

Similar electron diffraction patterns were obtained from other grain boundary B2 precipitates.Fig. 11(e–i) of the STEM-EDS results from this specific grain boundary region confirm that the B2 phase is rich in Al (26.6 at. %) and Ni (45.8 at. %), while being depleted in Co (14.6 at. %), Cr (2.0 at. %), and Fe (10.9 at. %).

3.3,Results.Effect of microstructure on mechanical properties,"Samples of the three conditions, CRSA, CRSA-620 and CR-620, were tensile-tested, and the corresponding engineering stress-strain plots are shown inFig. 15. The CRSA condition has yield strength (YS) ∼230 MPa and ultimate tensile strength (UTS) ∼ 550 MPa, with an elongation to failure (EF) of ∼60%, accompanied by substantial strain hardening. The CRSA-620 condition with thefcc+ L12microstructure exhibited YS ∼480 MPa, UTS∼ 820 MPa and EF of ∼45%. The increase in strength due to precipitation of the ordered intermetallic L12phase can be observed clearly in this case. In the CR-620 condition, which consists of a fine-scale mixture of three phases consisting offccgrains, B2 and sigma precipitates, YS ∼820 MPa, UTS ∼1050 MPa and EF is reduced to ∼35%. Hence, the prior thermo-mechanical treatment not only influenced the microstructural evolution but also had an immense impact on the strength-ductility properties of this alloy.",['fig15'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Experimentally observed transformation pathway,The two thermomechanical processing routes followed to process the Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy resulted in extremely different microstructures. A schematic correlating the processing route to the resultant microstructure is shown inFig. 16.,['fig16'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Experimentally observed transformation pathway,"While the CRSA-620 condition mainly exhibited a microstructure consisting of anfccmatrix, together with intra-granular nanoscale ordered precipitates, and grain boundary B2 precipitates, the CR-620 condition exhibited a three-phase microstructure comprised of a fine (1–3 μm) grain sizefccmatrix with grains of σ and B2 phases precipitating along the grain boundaries (or sub-grain boundaries) as well as interphase boundaries.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Microstructural evolution in case of the CRSA-620 condition,"The isothermal annealing at 620 °C after fully recovering and recrystallizing the 90% cold-rolled sample (via high temperature annealing at 1150 °C) resulted in anfccmatrix with a grain size of ∼20 μm and ordered precipitates of size scale 20–50 nm. The majority of ordered precipitates were consistently indexed at L12phase, though a second ordered phase was also observed. The atomic-resolution image of this new ordered phase reveals that the repeat unit cell for this ordered structure consists of eight consecutive {220}fcclattice planes. The details of the crystal structure, symmetry, and lattice parameters of this new ordered phase forming in the CRSA-620 condition, constitutes part of future study.",[],[]
4.3,Discussion.Microstructural evolution in case of the CR-620 condition,"Direct annealing of the Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy, at 620 °C, after cold rolling to a thickness reduction of 90%, results in a completely different transformation pathway as compared to isothermal annealing at 620 °C after fully recovering and recrystallizing the 90% cold-rolled sample (via high temperature annealing at 1150 °C). This direct annealed condition, referred to in this paper as the CR-620 condition, the recovery and recrystallization processes occur concurrently (or in close succession) with precipitation of the ordered intermetallic phases. Thus, recrystallization initiates in the cold-rolled microstructure on the deformation bands which are a mixture of deformation twins and regions with a high dislocation density. This recrystallization results in the development of local regions with fully recrystallized fine scalefccgrains. Early stages of such recrystallization can be observed even in case of the as cold-rolled sample (refer toFig. 1(b)), prior to any annealing. Based on the final microstructure, it can be presumed that concurrently with recrystallization, the grain boundaries in these fine-grained recrystallized regions act as heterogeneous nucleation sites for both the B2 and σ phases, resulting in the development of a fine-grained three-phasefcc+ B2 + σ microstructure. With increasing annealing period, this fine-grained three-phase microstructure spreads across the entire sample. The details with regards to specific nucleation sites of the B2 and σ phases, and their evolution, are yet to be investigated and will be the subject of future study.",['fig1'],[]
4.4,Discussion.Thermodynamic modeling of phase stability and transformations,"The isopleth section with varying Al content for the AlxCoCrFeNi system (Fig. 17(a)) is calculated using computational thermodynamic (CALPHAD approach) with input from the TCHEA2 thermodynamic assessment from ThermoCalc [63]. The composition Al0.3CoCrFeNi, corresponding to the alloy under investigation, is marked with a vertical dotted line on this isopleth, and the temperature of 620 °C is marked with a horizontal dotted line. The intersection of these two dotted lines inFig. 17(a) predicts that the thermodynamic stable phases for this composition at 620 °C arefcc+ B2 + σ. The ordered L12phase is not thermodynamically stable at this temperature, as ascertained by the calculated fractions of the equilibrium phase fractions in this alloy as a function of temperature (Fig. 17(b)) based on the predictions afforded by the thermodynamic models. At 620 °C, the predicted molar fractions of the different phases are 40.3%fcc(disordered), 38.9% B2 (ordered bcc) and 20.8% sigma (σ). Consequently, the homogeneous intra-granular precipitation of L12(γ′) precipitates within thefccmatrix in the case of isothermal annealing of a homogenized and fully-recrystallized Al0.3CoCrFeNi alloy at 620 °C for 50 h is rather interesting. By contrast, direct isothermal annealing at 620 °C for 50 h, after cold-rolling to 90% (without an intermediate recrystallization anneal at 1150 °C), resulted in precipitation of the equilibriumfcc+ B2 + σ phases, without any L12(γ′) precipitation. These results clearly indicate the influence of thermo-mechanical processing on the solid-solid phase transformation pathway adopted by this alloy. To understand the differences between both thermal treatments, we considered the kinetics of onset precipitate nucleation, which is the first stage during precipitate formation.","['fig17', 'fig17', 'fig17']",[]
4.4,Discussion.Thermodynamic modeling of phase stability and transformations,"Nucleation is driven by the reduction in chemical super saturation of the matrix, and depends at the beginning on composition and temperature. The Al0.3CoCrFeNifccsolid solution is metastable at 620 °C (Fig. 17(a) and (b)); as a consequence, there is a thermodynamic possibility for the formation of new phases. Positive onset driving forces for nucleation of stable B2 & σ and metastable L12&bccphases from the supersaturatedfccmatrix (Fig. 18(a)), calculated from the description of the Gibbs free energy curves, show the competition between and among different precipitate types. The B2 phase has the maximum driving force among the three different phases at 620 °C; while L12, σ, andbccphases have similar driving forces, with L12being marginally higher. While the experimental results from the CR-620 are in agreement with the thermodynamic prediction offcc+ B2 + σ phases, the CRSA-620 condition primarily exhibitsfcc+ L12as the major phases, with a small fraction of B2 precipitates at the grain boundaries. The possible effect of nucleation rate of the different phases is discussed briefly to explain this difference between the microstructures of the two conditions.","['fig17', 'fig18']",[]
4.4,Discussion.Thermodynamic modeling of phase stability and transformations,"According to classical nucleation theory [64], the most important parameter controlling nucleation rate is the activation barrier for nucleus formation. For spherical precipitates forming in a perfect lattice with no strain, the nucleation barrier can be expressed as:ΔG∗=163πγ3ΔGV2whereγis the interfacial energy between the precipitating second phase and thefccmatrix andΔGVis the onset driving force for precipitation.",[],[]
4.4,Discussion.Thermodynamic modeling of phase stability and transformations,"Since the interfacial energy values for the L12orbccor B2 or σ phases precipitating within thefccmatrix of this HEA are not available and are rather difficult to compute, as a first approximation, these values have been adopted from other conventional alloy systems. Since computed and experimental values for γ/γ′ interfacial energy in Ni-Al system range between 8 and 24 mJ/m2[65–68], we considered this range for theγ(fcc/L12) interfacial energy. Estimates forγ(fcc/bcc) interfacial energy range between 180 and 660 mJ/m2in Fe-Ni and Ni-Cr systems [69–74]; this range of values was selected for theγ(fcc/bcc) andγ(fcc/B2) interfacial energy. Theγ(fcc/σ) interfacial energy is supposed to be higher, and we assumed a realistic range of 500–800 mJ/m2[75].",[],[]
4.4,Discussion.Thermodynamic modeling of phase stability and transformations,"Fig. 18 (b)shows clearly that the normalized nucleation barrier (ΔG∗/kT) for the L12phase is the minimum, due largely to the lowγ(fcc/L12) interfacial energy, a consequence of the fact that the ordered L12phase is based on the same parentfccstructure or lattice as the matrixfccphase. In contrast, the substantially largerγ(fcc/B2) andγ(fcc/σ) interfacial energies led to much higher values ofΔG∗/kTfor the B2 (based on a parentbccstructure) and σ (very large lattice parameter, tetragonal structure) phases. Both the B2 and σ phases form semi-coherent or incoherent interfaces with thefccmatrix and hence have a high nucleation barrier. Therefore, in case of CRSA-620 condition where the matrix consists of fully-recrystallized, strain-freefccgrains, the high nucleation barrier for the B2 and σ phases complicates homogeneous nucleation throughout the matrix. The grain boundaries are the only heterogeneous nucleation sites amenable to precipitation of these phases, and the lower value of the nucleation barrier for the B2 phase as compared with the σ phase makes it easier to precipitate the B2 phase at these grain boundaries. Within the fully-recrystallizedfccgrains in the CRSA-620 condition, the lowerΔG∗for the L12phase leads to a homogeneous nanometer scale precipitation of this phase, despite the fact that, from a thermodynamic perspective, the L12phase is a metastable phase. These simple thermodynamic considerations suggest that formation of the L12phase may be favored due to higher homogenous nucleation rate compared to other competing equilibrium phases.",['fig18'],[]
4.4,Discussion.Thermodynamic modeling of phase stability and transformations,"On the contrary, in case of the sample that was directly annealed after cold-rolling at 620 °C, (the CR-620 condition), the precipitation of second phases occurs under rather different circumstances. As discussed previously, the 90% cold-rolled microstructure consists of a high density of dislocations and deformation twins, as well as of localized recrystallized regions with fine-scalefccgrains. The presence of these defects; i.e., deformation twin boundaries, dislocation cell walls, and grain boundaries between the fine recrystallized grains forming during rolling, all act as heterogeneous nucleation sites for the equilibrium B2 and σ phases within the priorfccmatrix, and consequently reduce the heterogeneous nucleation barrier (lowerΔGhet∗). Therefore, the sequence of phase evolution in the CR-620 condition involves concurrent recrystallization of fine-scalefccgrains and the heterogeneous precipitation of B2 and σ phases. This results in a homogeneous distribution of all three phases ―fcc+ B2 + σ within the microstructure ― and leads to an excellent balance of high strength, very good ductility, and excellent strain-hardenability.",[],[]
4.5,Discussion.Influence of microstructure on tensile properties,"As shown earlier in this paper, the CRSA, CRSA-620, and CR-620 conditions of thefcc-based Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA exhibit strikingly different tensile properties. While the CRSA and CRSA-620 samples had relatively coarsefccgrains (∼20 μm), the CR-620 sample had a highly refined recrystallized microstructure with ∼1–3 μmfccgrains. Previous work clearly demonstrates that this alloy exhibits a very large Hall-Petch hardening coefficient, and a Hall-Petch type relationship has been determined for the yield strength of the singlefccphase in this alloy [47]:σHP=σ0+KHPd−1/2;with the Hall-Petch coefficients, Kσand intrinsic yield strength of the alloy σ0, being 824 MPa (μm0.5) and 95 MPa respectively [47]. Based on this it can be concluded that the CR-620 sample will exhibit a substantially higher yield strength as compared to the CRSA-620 and CRSA samples in agreement with the experimentally measured tensile properties. While the CRSA-620 sample contains a nanometer-scale distribution of L12precipitates the total phase fraction of these intermetallic precipitates is only ∼20%, based on approximate measurements using dark-field TEM images. This L12phase fraction is quite low considering that present day commercially-used nickel-base superalloys in turbine jet engines typically contain greater than 50% γ’ (L12) precipitates in thefccNi-base matrix [76]. Therefore, in case of the Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA, there is only a limited degree of precipitation strengthening that can be achieved via L12precipitates. Consequently, the while the CRSA-620 sample exhibits a higher strength as compared to the CRSA sample, its strength is substantially lower than that of the finer grained CR-620 sample. In addition to the finerfccgrain size, the intermetallic B2 and σ precipitates present in the CR-620 sample lead to additional strengthening of this sample.",[],[]
5,Summary and conclusion,"The effect of thermo-mechanical treatment on phase evolution in anfcc-based Al0.3CoCrFeNi HEA was investigated. While the alloy was precipitation strengthenable [47] by introducing hard-coherent intermetallic phase in the matrix via the first processing route, the second route achieved the equilibrium phases. The following can be established from the current study:1.Strain-free, single-phasefccstructure in this alloy when aged at 620 °C for 50 h resulted primarily in afcc+ L12microstructure with B2 pinning the grain boundaries. An additional second ordered phase was found in this condition, with a much larger unit cell and a repeat unit of eight {220}fccplanes.2.The order-disorder transition associated with the formation of the L12phase in this HEA was investigated viain situsynchrotron XRD annealing experiments, and the order-disorder transition temperature was determined to be ∼670 °C.3.Strained single-phasefccstructure when aged at 620 °C for 50 h resulted in a tri-phase mixture offcc+ B2 + sigma phase.4.CALPHAD predictions using Thermo-Calc were to justify the results obtained via the second processing route. Thermodynamic calculations illustrate that the precipitation of the L12phase observed in the first processing route can be explained by homogeneous nucleation, while the possible effect of heterogeneous nucleation of B2 and σ during the second processing route was discussed.5.Changes in mechanical properties associated with microstructural changes are clear.",[],[]
