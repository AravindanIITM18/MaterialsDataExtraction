0,Abstract,"Owning to their excellent thermal stability and high strength at elevated temperature, high entropy alloys (HEAs) possess great potential for the application in aviation and aerospace fields. In present work, two novel Nb–Ni–Ti–Co–Zr and Nb–Ni–Ti–Co–Zr–Hf HEAs were prepared by arc melting and copper mold suction-casting method. The microstructure, phase stability, mechanical properties at room temperature and elevated temperature of the two HEAs were studied. Both of the HEAs possess high yield stress at room temperature, especially for the Nb–Ni–Ti–Co–Zr (with 2331Mpa). In addition, the Nb–Ni–Ti–Co–Zr HEA exhibited high yield stress of 564Mpa at elevated temperature of 800°C and large compressive plastic strain (more than 50% at 800°C). Nb–Ni–Ti–Co–Zr–Hf alloy showed new phase precipitation at 800°C, whereas the structure of Nb–Ni–Ti–Co–Zr was more stable, which is one of the reason why it possesses high strength at room temperature and elevated temperature. The high temperature properties of the Nb–Ni–Ti–Co–Zr HEA make it promising for high temperature application.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High entropy alloys (HEAs), which contain at least 5 components in equiatomic or near-equiatomic ratio, have been considered as a new material in recent years[1–4]. It is known that the high mixing entropy could decrease the Gibbs free energy and result in the formation of solid solution phase of HEAs. Due to the high entropy and their complex microstructure in the multi-elements alloys, HEAs exhibit many attractive properties, such as high strength at both cryogenic temperatures[5–7]and high temperatures[8–12], strong corrosion resistance[13,14], outstanding wear resistance[15,16], excellent magnetic properties[17]and good glass-forming ability[18-19].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In particularly, the refractory high entropy alloys (HEAs) possess dramatic mechanical properties at high temperatures due to their high meting temperature and strong solid solution strengthening, and possess very high yield strength (σ0.2) in the temperature range from 20°C to 1000°C. Although there are several refractory HEA systems with a simple solid solution structure, including Nb–Ta–Mo–W[10,11], Nb–Ti–Zr[8,12,20–24]and Nb–Ti–V–Al[25], have been successfully developed, the components of the reported refractory HEAs are limited in Nb, Ta, V, W, Ti, Zr, Hf and Al. Thus, developing refractory HEAs with other elements is of importance.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Since Ni-based and Co-based superalloys have been wildly applied[26,27]due to their excellent mechanical properties at elevated temperature, Ni and Co elements could be served as alloying elements in the refractory HEAs. In present work, by selecting Ni, Co, and the commonly used constituent elements such as Nb, Ti, Zr and Hf in refractory HEAs, two new refractory HEAs of Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20and Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7were developed. The structural stability, mechanical properties at both room temperature and elevated temperatures have been investigated.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"The Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20and Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEAs in equiatomic ratio were prepared by vacuum arc melting of the mixtures of the metals in a Ti-gettered pure argon atmosphere. The purities of Nb, Ni, Co and Ti are over 99.9 mass%, and the purities of Zr and Hf are over 99.2 mass%. Each ingot was re-melted at least five times to ensure the compositional homogeneity. Then cylindrical rods were prepared by copper mold suction casting. The structure of the as-cast rods and anneal samples was characterized by Rigaku D/max-RB X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Cu Kα radiation. To measure the room temperature mechanical properties of the alloys, the compression tests were performed on WDW-50 testing machine at a strain rate of 4×10−4s−1. The samples were cut out from the as-castϕ3mm rods with gage aspect ratio of 2:1. The elevated temperature compression tests were carried out with Gleeble3500 thermal simulator at a strain of 1×10−3s−1using samples with a dimension ofϕ6mm×9mm. The fractured samples were examined by Quanta 200 FEG scanning electron microscope (SEM). The hardness and elastic constants of the novel HEAs were measured by MH-3 vickers hardness tester and Teclab resonance ultrasonic spectrometer, respectively.",[],[]
3,Results and discussions," Fig. 1 a shows the XRD spectrum of the as-cast Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20alloy sample. Two body-centered cubic (BCC) phases with lattice constants of 3.14Å and 3.33Å were indexed., The XRD spectrum of the annealed Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20alloy sample after annealed at 800°C for 1h is shown in Fig. 1 b, where the characteristic peaks are nearly the same as those in the XRD spectrum of as-cast sample. The indexing of the XRD spectrum confirmed that the annealed sample was still consisted of two BCC phases with lattice constants of 3.14Å and 3.33Å. Thus, the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20alloy possesses excellent structural stability below 800°C.","['f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3,Results and discussions," Fig. 1 c shows the XRD spectrum of the as-cast Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEA sample, where a BCC crystal structure, a faced-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure and a NbNi intermetallic phase were indentified. The lattice constants of the BCC and FCC phases were measured to be 4.48Å (a′1) and 4.74Å (a′2), respectively. By comparing the XRD results of the as-cast Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20and Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7alloys, it could be found that the addition of Hf can promote the phase transformation from BCC phase to FCC phase. Similar FCC to BCC phase transformation phenomenon has been observed in CuCrFeNiCu1−xAlxHEAs when increase the Al content[28]. The phase transformation phenomenon was reported to be closely related to the great lattice constant difference between the Al and other elements.",['f0005'],[]
3,Results and discussions,"After annealing at 800°C for one hour, a new NbHf2phase was observed in the XRD spectrum of the annealed Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEA sample, as shown in Fig. 1 d. The precipitation of new phase might be on account of the obviously increased lattice constants in the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA, which could promote the migration of Ni and Co elements with relatively low melt point and small atom radius.( Table 1 )",['f0005'],['t0005']
3,Results and discussions,"The optical microscopic images of the as-cast and annealed HEAs are shown in Fig. 2 , where all the samples exhibited dendritic structure. The grain size of the as-cast Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA sample was somehow non-uniform, and the average grain size was ~5μm. The as-cast Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEA sample possessed a similar grain size (as shown in Fig. 2 c). After annealing, the grain sizes of both the two HEAs didn’t change, indicating that no obvious grain growth occurred during the annealing process.","['f0010', 'f0010']",[]
3,Results and discussions,"The micro-hardness of the two as-cast and annealed alloys was measured by MH-3 vickers hardness tests, and the values of hardness are shown in Table 2 . The hardness of the as-cast Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA was 527.3±6.9. After annealing, the hardness of the annealed sample decreased to 489.2±25.3, which might be resulted by the stress relief during the annealing process. The hardness of the as-cast Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEA was 515.5±11.2. While after annealing, the hardness of the sample slightly increased to 520.1±2.0, which could be associated with the formation of the NbHf2.",[],['t0010']
3,Results and discussions,"The elastic constants of the two HEAs were also investigated. The Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA possessed a bulk modulus of 185GPa, a shear modulus of 90GPa, a Youngs modulus of 234GPa and Possion's ratio of 0.290. The Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEA possessed a bulk modulus of 170GPa, a shear modulus of 110GPa, a Youngs modulus of 272GPa and a Possion's ratio of 0.233.",[],[]
3,Results and discussions," Fig. 3 shows the stress–strain curves of the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20and Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEAs. Theσ0.2value of the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA is as high as 2331Mpa, and the fracture occurred at the peak stress (σu) of 2504Mpa. The high stress of the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA may be due to its BCC structures with relatively high strength and the small grain size, which both can promote the strength of the crystalline materials. In addition, the strong bonding inherited from the fractory elements and the high solution hardening effect of the matrix can also enhance the strength of the HEA.",['f0015'],[]
3,Results and discussions,"Theσ0.2value of the Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEA is of 1469Mpa, which is much lower than that of the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA. This low compressive strength might be partly caused by the existence of FCC phase with relatively low strength. But the Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEA exhibits slightly better plasticity, as shown in Fig. 3 .",['f0015'],[]
3,Results and discussions,"SEM images of the fracture surfaces of the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20and Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEAs are shown in Fig. 4 . It could be found that both of the two HEA samples exhibited a typical shear fracture mode at room temperature with a shearing angle of ~45o, as shown in Fig. 4 a and c. Flat facets, river-pattern markings and cleavage feathers were noticed in the higher magnification images shown in Fig. 4 b and d, indicating the characteristics of the quasi-cleavage fracture.","['f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020']",[]
3,Results and discussions,"The good phase stability at high temperature is strongly correlated to the superior mechanical properties at elevated temperature. Thus, in present study, only the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA, which possess both higher strength at room temperature and better phase stability, was employed to explore its mechanical properties at 600–1000°C. The compression stress–strain curves of the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA at elevated temperatures were shown in Fig. 5 . The values of theσ0.2andσuat different temperatures were listed in Table 3 . Theσ0.2value of the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA was 1385Mpa at 600°C, and the brittle fracture occurred atσuof 1566Mpa. As the temperature increased to 700°C, theσ0.2value decreased to 668Mpa and a brittle to ductile transition occurred. The brittle to ductile transition temperature (BDTT) could be clearly observed in the temperature ranges from 600°C to 700°C. All the fracture strain (ε) values of the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA in the temperature range of 700–1000°C were more than 50%. With the increasing temperature, theσ0.2value of the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA decreased gradually. When the temperature raised to 1000°C, theσ0.2value of the Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA dropped to 60Mpa.",['f0025'],['t0015']
3,Results and discussions,"The decreasedσ0.2from 1385Mpa at 600°C to 668Mpa at 700°C might own to the brittle to ductile transition. However, it is known that the weakening of chemical bond between metal elements generally happened at temperatures above about 0.5–0.6 times of the absolutely melt pointTm(they are 611–787°C for Co, and 590–762°C for Ni, respectively). Thus, the significantly decreased ofσ0.2at the temperature above 700°C might result from the weakening of chemical bond of Co and Ni elements.",[],[]
4,Conclusions,"Two new HEAs of Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20and Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7had been developed. The Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA is consisted by two BCC phases. With Hf addition, a BCC phase, a FCC phase and a NbNi intermetallic phase were indentified in the Nb16.7Ni16.7Ti16.7Co16.7Zr16.7Hf16.7HEA. The Nb20Ni20Ti20Co20Zr20HEA possesses excellent structural stability, and exhibits high yield strength from 20°C to 800°C and large strain above 700°C, which makes it promising for application at high temperature.",[],[]
