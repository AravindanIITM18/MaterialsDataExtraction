f0020,articles_test/10.1016.j.matdes.2017.01.036/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,EBSD orientation maps with pole figures showing one phase FCC bulk material with no significant preferred orientation of its grains. Deformation twin boundaries are denoted by wider black lines. Note that the apparent density of the twins appears somewhat lower in the image due to resolution constraints.

(c) SAED pattern of FCC grain in 110 orientation. (d) SAED pattern of an oxide particle matching the calculated reflections for aluminum oxide. Arrows inFig. 5a indicate oxide inclusions, arrows inFig. 5b indicated dislocations pinned at oxide inclusions."
