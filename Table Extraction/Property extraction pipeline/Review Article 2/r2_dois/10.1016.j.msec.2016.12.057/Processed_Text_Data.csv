0,Abstract,"Combining the high-entropy alloy (HEA) concept with property requirement for orthopedic implants, we designed a Ti20Zr20Nb20Ta20Mo20 equiatomic HEA. The arc-melted microstructures, compressive properties and potentiodynamic polarization behavior in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) were studied in detail. It was revealed that the as-cast TiZrNbTaMo HEA consisted of dual phases with bcc structure, major bcc1 and minor bcc2 phases with the lattice parameters of 0.3310nm and 0.3379nm, respectively. As confirmed by nanoindentation tests, the bcc1 phase is somewhat harder and stiffer than the bcc2 phase. The TiZrNbTaMo HEA exhibited Young's modulus of 153GPa, Vickers microhardness of 4.9GPa, compressive yield strength of σ                     y                     =1390MPa and apparent plastic strain of ε                     p                     ≈6% prior to failure. Moreover, the TiZrNbTaMo HEA manifested excellent corrosion resistance in PBS, comparable to the Ti6Al4V alloy, and pitting resistance remarkably superior to the 316L SS and CoCrMo alloys. These preliminary advantages of the TiZrNbTaMo HEA over the current orthopedic implant metals in mechanical properties and corrosion resistance offer an opportunity to explore new orthopedic-implant alloys based on the TiZrNbTaMo concentrated composition.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Metallic materials have been key materials to fabricate the orthopedic implants, due to their advantage in superior mechanical properties, including the high yield strength, ductility, fatigue strength and fracture toughness. Typically, the cobalt-chromium-molybdenum (CoCrMo) and titanium alloys are currently used for artificial joint replacement such as hip, knee, and shoulder prostheses[1–3]. In spite of the good biocompatibility, titanium alloys (e.g., Ti6Al4V) are inadequate to be used as bearing surfaces owing to their poor wear resistance, which is probably associated with the low shear strength and repassivation behavior of the surface oxide layer[1]. In contrast, CoCrMo alloys (e.g., Co28Cr6Mo, complying with the ASTM F75 for cast and the ASTM F799 for wrought alloys) are more wear-resistant, and are clinically used as bearing surfaces of the joint prostheses, such as artificial joint of metal-on-metal (MoM) bearings which was re-introduced by the early 1980s as an alternative to metal-on-polyethylene (MoP) bearings. Recently, however, it becomes a great concern that some CoCrMo bearings have shown unacceptably high failure rate[3]. Patient with CoCrMo implants may have increased metal ion levels of cobalt and chromium in the blood[4–6]. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that metal particulates and their byproducts may be associated with cytotoxicity, DNA damage, metal hypersensitivity reactions and pseudotumors[7–11]. In this sense, the current orthopedic materials are not perfect, and it remains of interest to develop newer, more wear resistant bearing couples that could last the lifetime of implants[12].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"As suggested by Willmann[13], the ideal materials used for bearing surfaces in joint replacement should exhibit the following properties: a biocompatible chemical composition to avoid adverse tissue reactions, an excellent resistance to corrosion in the human body environment, high hardness and stiffness to maintain good wear resistance, synoviaphilicity for lubrication and low friction, and high thermal conduction coefficient to avoid proteinous synovia degeneration. In this sense, high modulus of material is required to ensure the wear resistance of bearing surfaces and avoid deformation of the articulating surfaces under peak load of eight-time body weight. It should be emphasized that such a requirement for bearing surface materials is different from some prostheses such as the femoral stems and tibial trays[14,15], where the materials with lower modulus are expected to reduce the stress-shielding effects that cause peri-prosthetic bone resorption and aseptic loosening[16].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Recently, it is of interest to note that high-entropy alloys (HEAs) with compositional features of multicomponent (five or more elements) and equiatomic or near-equiatomic concentration have attracted much attention[17–24], due to their potentially interesting properties. Meanwhile, vast opportunities for new compositions and microstructures are offered by this area, in particular for complex concentrated alloys (CCAs)[25]. Ever since Senkov et al.[26]firstly developed refractory HEAs with a single bcc phase in W-Nb-Mo-Ta and W-Nb-Mo-Ta-V alloy systems, several bcc HEAs based on the early transition metals were studied on phase selection and preliminary mechanical properties, including the Nb-Mo-Ta-W, V-Nb-Mo-Ta-W, Ta-Nb-Hf-Zr-Ti, Hf-Nb-Ti-Zr, Hf-Mo-Ta-Ti-Zr and Hf-Mo-Nb-Ta-Ti-Zr equiatomic alloys[27–32]. These HEAs exhibit high yield strength (σy=900–1600MPa) at ambient temperature, among which someone manifests sizable compressive plasticity. From the biocompatibility perspective, it is interesting to note that majority of these elements are biocompatible[33–38], except the toxic vanadium[39]. Even considering the situation of metal ion release from metal implant, released metal ions of zirconium, niobium and tantalum belong to titanium-type ion, and do not always combine with biomolecules to appear toxicity because active ion immediately combines with a water molecule or an anion near the ion to form an oxide, hydroxide, or inorganic salt[40].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Combining the HEAs concept with elemental biocompatibility, we initiate to design a biocompatible HEA potentially used for orthopedic implants. The Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta-Mo quinary system was selected as the base composition. Hafnium was excluded due to its less resistance to tribocorrosion in simulated body fluid[41], while molybdenum with high elastic modulus (E=324GPa) was introduced in the alloy, which is expected to play a role to enhance the wear resistance[38]. To this end, the purpose of this paper is three-fold. First, as-cast microstructure and phase selection of arc-melted TiZrNbTaMo alloy were characterized. Second, fundamental mechanical properties of the HEA were investigated, including the Young's modulus, Vickers microhardness and compressive properties. Third, electrochemical behavior of the HEA in phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was examined with potentiodynamic polarization tests, preliminarily to assess its corrosion resistance under physiological environment, together with a comparison with the Ti6Al4V, 316L SS and CoCrMo alloys. Finally, solid-solution strengthening mechanism in the alloy was discussed in terms of Labusch approach.",[],[]
2,Material and methods,"Using commercial elemental bulk materials with purity higher than 99.9% (in weight percentage) as starting materials, quinary Ti-Zr-Nb-Ta-Mo alloy ingots in equiatomic fraction were fabricated by arc melting. Arc-melted ingots in weight of about 50g were fabricated under a Ti-gettered argon atmosphere in a water-cooled copper hearth, subjected to remelting and flipping of several runs to ensure compositional homogeneity. The final average composition of the alloy was confirmed with energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), as listed in Table 1 .",[],['t0005']
2,Material and methods,"Crystalline structure of the as-cast TiZrNbTaMo HEA was analyzed by x-ray diffraction (XRD) using a Rigaku D/max 2500 diffractometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan) with monochromatic Cu Kαradiation. Lattice parameters of crystalline phases with bcc structure were determined using (321) diffraction lines. Step-scanning mode was used for scanning within a range of relevant diffraction angle (2θ) to ensure the accuracy of measured position of diffraction peaks. Microstructure of the as-cast alloy was examined under a Quanta 600 scanning electron microscope (SEM) (FEI, Eindhoven, The Netherlands). Chemical composition and elemental mapping on cross-section surfaces of the as-cast alloy were analyzed using an EDX detector attached on SEM.",[],[]
2,Material and methods,"Measurements of Vickers microhardness were conducted on as-polished cross-section surface of the alloy specimen using a Mitutoyo MVK-H3 hardness testing machine equipped with a 136° Vickers diamond pyramid under 200g load dwelt for 20s. The samples were mechanically ground with SiC abrasive papers to 2000 grits, and then polished with 2.5μm diamond paste, followed by supersonic cleaning in ethanol and distilled water. At least fifty individual measurements were performed to ensure the reproducibility.",[],[]
2,Material and methods,"To characterize the hardness and Young's modulus of constituent phases, nanoindentation tests were carried out on the cross-section surface using a Nano Indenter G200 (Agilent Technologies, USA) with Berkovich indenter with tip radius of 20nm. The sample surface was mechanically ground with SiC abrasive papers to 2000 grits, and then polished with 1μm Al2O3suspension and subsequent 0.04μm colloidal silica. The fine-polished sample was further ion-milled to remove potential deformation layer on the surface, followed by ultrasonic cleaning in ethanol and distilled water. The final surface roughness was determined to be about 20nm using a LEXT OLS4000 laser scanning confocal microscope (Olympus, USA). Indentation was performed in depth-control mode of depth limit of 350nm with surface approach velocity of 10nm/s, peak hold time of 10s and data acquisition frequency of 5Hz.",[],[]
2,Material and methods,"Cylindrical specimens machined from the as-cast alloy ingot for compression tests were 4.5mm in diameter and 9.0mm in height. They were taken from middle part of the cross-section of alloy ingot in order to associate with the representative microstructures. Compression tests were performed at ambient temperature with a computer-controlled AG-I mechanical testing machine (Shimadzu, Japan). A thin Teflon sheet was used between specimen loading surface and dies to reduce the friction-induced confinement. Quasistatic strain rate applied on the specimens was controlled at 10−3s−1. At least four specimens were tested to ensure the reproducibility. Morphology of fractured surfaces for representative failure specimens under compression were examined under SEM.",[],[]
2,Material and methods,"Phosphate buffer solution (PBS) was used preliminarily to assess the corrosion resistance of the alloy under simulated physiological environment[42,43]. Electrochemical behavior in PBS was examined with potentiodynamic polarization tests. Cubic specimens with dimension of 5mm×5mm×5mm were taken from middle part of the cross-section of alloy ingot, connected to the copper wire, embedded in a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) holder, mounted in epoxy resin, and then ground with emery paper to 1200 grits for the tests. The measurements were conducted on a Model 2273 electrochemical workstation (EG&G Princeton Applied Research), connected to a three electrode cell with saturated calomel as reference electrode and platinum foil as counter electrode. The PBS electrolyte with the recipe the same as in previous work[42]was deoxygenized by high-purity N2flow. The temperature was maintained at 37±1°C using a thermostatic bath. Prior to the measurements, the specimens were immersed in electrolyte for 1h, in order to attain a stable state of open circuit potential (OCP). Potentiodynamic polarization was measured in a range from −0.35V versus OCP to 1.2VSCEwith a scanning rate of 0.167mV/s. For comparison, three conventional implant metals, commercial Ti6Al4V (ASTM F1472), 316L SS (ASTM F138) and Co28Cr6Mo (ASTM F799) were examined as well with potentiodynamic polarization tests under identical test conditions. They were supplied by the Baotai Group Co. Ltd., the Trauson (China) Medical Instrument Co. Ltd. and the Shanghai Citai Non-ferrous Metal Materials Co. Ltd., respectively.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Microstructure characterization," Fig. 1(a) –(c)illustrate XRD patterns of the as-cast TiZrNbTaMo alloy. It was indicated that a bcc1 phase in predominant fraction and a bcc2 phase in trace amount coexisted in the alloy, as shown in Fig. 1(a) . The (110) peak of bcc2 phase as a shoulder of that of bcc1 phase appeared at a slightly lower Bragg angle, reflecting its lattice parameter (a) slightly greater than that of the bcc1 phase. Based on the integrated intensity of the most intensive diffraction peaks, whose line profiles were deconvoluted with Lorentz function, volume fraction of minor bcc2 phase was approximately estimated to be ~30%, as shown in Fig. 1(b) .","['f0005', 'f0005', 'f0005']",[]

From the deconvoluted (321) peaks, lattice parameters were determined to be 0.3310nm for bcc1 and 0.3379nm for bcc2 phase, as shown in Fig. 1(c) .",['f0005'],[]
3.1,Results.Microstructure characterization," Fig. 2(a)  and (b)display SEM images of arc-melted TiZrNbTaMo HEA, taken from the cross-sections of the top and middle parts of ingot, respectively. As indicated, solidified microstructure of the alloy somewhat varied with cooling rate of the melt. At the top area slowly cooled under argon atmosphere, typical microstructures consisted of light-contrast dendrites and continuous dark-contrast interdendritic matrix, as shown in Fig. 2(a) . As analyzed by EDX, chemical compositions of dendritic (DR) and interdendritic (ID) regions at the top and middle parts of the alloy ingot were summarized in Table 1 , along with the global numbers of DR, ID and average for comparison. It was shown that severe segregation of Ta and partial segregation of Mo and Nb took place in dendritic arms, while the Ti and Zr were enriched in interdendritic regions, especially higher enrichment of the Zr with respect to the Ti. Such a finding accorded with the element-mapping results, as shown in Fig. 3 . In the middle part of ingot subjected to a rapid cooling rate, Ta- and Mo-rich dendritic arms grew well, and interconnected to form the coarse dendrites separated by interdendritic regions, as showed in Fig. 2(b) . As noticed in Table 1 , maximal concentration difference of dendritic arms and interdendritic regions between top and middle parts of ingot reached to be 4at.% for Ta and 3at.% for Zr. As a result, it is conclusive that the variation in chemical compositions of dendritic arms and interdendritic regions is insignificant in the entire alloy ingot. On an average, global composition of dendritic arms was determined to be Ti15Zr10Nb20Ta31Mo24. In contrast, the interdendritic regions were at a composition of Ti24Zr43Nb12Ta8Mo13. The micro-segregations in composition are generally attributed to two factors. On one hand, elements Nb, Ta and Mo with higher melting temperature (Tm) prefer to solidify into dendritic arms, whereas the Ti and Zr with lowerTmare subsequently segregated into the interdendritic regions. On the other hand, as shown in phase diagram of binary Zr-Ta[44], phase separation of β-phase (Zr-Ta) would take place at 2020K to decompose into Zr-rich and Ta-rich phases. This temperature is very close to the estimated homogenizing annealing temperature of the ingot (~0.8Tm), implying that the thermodynamically-driven phase separation is effective in the case.","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0015', 'f0010']","['t0005', 't0005']"
3.1,Results.Microstructure characterization,"Combined with XRD results including the volume fractions and lattice parameters of two bcc phases, dendritic arms of Ti15Zr10Nb20Ta31Mo24and interdendritic regions of Ti24Zr43Nb12Ta8Mo13can be identified as major bcc1 and minor bcc2 phases, respectively. Their lattice parameters situated between those of bcc-structure Ti, Nb, Ta, Mo and Zr, reflecting expanded unit cell volume with respect to the Ti, Nb, Ta and Mo but contracted one to the Zr. Using the “Vegard's rule of mixtures” and element concentrations in each bcc phase, lattice parameteramixof ideal disordered solid solutions of two bcc phases are calculated,(2)amix=∑ciaiwhereciandaiare the concentration and lattice parameter of theith alloying element, respectively. Note that the lattice parameters of bcc-type Ti and Zr that are only stable at elevated temperature are gained by the extrapolating from elevated temperature to room temperature[28]. The calculatedamixvalues are presented in Table 3 . As indicated, the calculatedamixvalue is approximately 0.6% less than measured one in the case of bcc1 phase, while it is approximately 0.5% greater than the measured one for bcc 2 phase. Such small deviations generally reflect that two bcc phases in solidified microstructures are close to be the random solid solutions, and their unit-cell volumes are substantially the compromised results of unit-cell volumes of each component, following the rule of mixtures.",[],['t0015']
3.2,Results.Microhardness and Young's modulus,"Vickers microhardness,Hv, of the as-cast TiZrNbTaMo HEA was determined to be 4.9±0.1GPa with a small variation of ~2%. It is interesting to note that the microhardness of the alloy does not simply obey the result estimated by “rule of mixtures” in terms of the properties of the constituent elements. For comparison, typicalHvvalues of each component at room temperature are listed in Table 2 [45]. According to the rule of mixtures, the microhardness,Hvmix=∑ciHvi, of the alloy was gained to be (Hv)mix=1.12GPa. This number is merely ~23% of the measured one. In addition, hardness of the alloy is approximately three-fold of the hardest Mo among the constituent elements. Evidently, such a remarkable hardening effect is attributed to solid solution-like strengthening, rather than in a “cocktail” way[46].",[],['t0010']
3.2,Results.Microhardness and Young's modulus," Fig. 4 displays load-versus-displacement curves under nanoindentations for dendritic and interdendritic regions in the TiZrNbTaMo HEA. The hardness and Young's modulus were calculated with Oliver and Pharr's method[47], in which the indentation hardnessHITand specimen's modulusEare derived from(3)HIT=Pmax/A(4)E=1−ν21/Er−1−νi2/Ei−1wherePmaxis the maximum indentation load,Ais the projected contact area of which second approximation was adopted thatA=24.5hc2+2400hcwherehcis the contact depth,Eris the reduced modulus,E,Ei(1141GPa) andν,νi(0.07) are Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the specimen and indenter, respectively. It is noteworthy that the Poisson's ratio of specimen,ν, is estimated in terms of a relation ofν=Emix/2Gmix−1, where theEmixandGmixare estimated according to the rule of mixtures, namely,Emix=∑cjEjandGmix=∑cjGj, where thecj,EjandGjare the atomic fraction, Young's modulus and shear modulus ofjth element, respectively. In first approximation, theHITvalue can be converted into theHvwith a relation ofHv=0.9081HIT, according to ISO 14577-1-2002[48]. These data are listed in Table 3 for comparison. As noted, theHvof bcc1 and bcc2 phases are given to be 6.4GPa and 5.7GPa, respectively, which are approximately 31% and 16% higher than the directly measuredHvof 4.9GPa for the overall specimen. As is well understood already, such a difference results from the indentation size effect[49]that measured hardness for crystalline materials increases as the penetration depth is reduced. It is noteworthy that the measured hardness values of two bcc phases are much higher than calculated ones with rule of mixtures, supporting the presence of solid-solution strengthening effect via elemental interaction.",['f0020'],['t0015']
3.2,Results.Microhardness and Young's modulus,"In parallel, the measuredE1of 161GPa for bcc1 phase is ~13% less than calculated value, while the bcc2 phase manifests a comparable level ofE2=133GPa. The integrated Young's modulus of the alloy is determined asE=153GPa weighted by volume fractions of two phases, with a relation ofE=φ1E1+φ2E2, whereφ1,E1andφ2,E2are the volume fraction and Young's modulus of bcc1 and bcc2 phases, respectively. As a matter of fact, enhancement of 12% in hardness and 21% in Young's modulus for bcc1 phase, with respect to bcc2 phase, is in consistence with a fact that bcc1 phase is enriched by harder and stiffer components such as Nb, Ta and Mo.",[],[]
3.3,Results.Compressive properties and fractography," Fig. 5 illustrates compressive engineering stress-versus-strain curves of three typical specimens for the as-cast TiZrNbTaMo HEA. Compressive yield strength at room temperature was determined to beσy=1390±75MPa. The samples manifest apparent plastic strain ofεp≈6% prior to failure via the splitting and fragmentation. In comparison with several attainable refractory HEAs such as the Ta20Nb20W20Mo20V20and Ta25Nb25W25Mo25[27], our TiZrNbTaMo alloy exhibits significantly higher yield strength and more sizable plasticity, noting theσy=1246MPa andεp≈1.7% for Ta20Nb20W20Mo20V20and theσy=1058MPa andεp≈2.1% for Ta25Nb25W25Mo25. In addition, according to Tabor relation[50]between hardness and yield strength of an isotropic material,σy=Hv/3, the estimatedσy=1630MPa for the TiZrNbTaMo HEA is ~17% higher than really measured value. In other words, the yield strength converted from Vickers microhardness for the current alloy yields slight overestimation.",['f0025'],[]
3.3,Results.Compressive properties and fractography,"As shown by an inset in Fig. 5 , the TiZrNbTaMo HEA samples under compression generally fractured in a way of splitting along the surfaces nearly parallel to the compressive loading direction. The failure specimen was opened along the main crack surface as shown in Fig. 6(a) in top-side view. Even in the eye-view, the fracture surface exhibited shinny facets, which is associated with superficial brittleness of the alloy. Fig. 6(c) –(f) show SEM images taken from the fracture surfaces at central portion of a typical TiZrNbTaMo specimen, in low and high magnification. As shown in Fig. 6(c) , the fracture surface is covered predominantly by fan-shaped cleavage patterns as well as shiny plastic tear ridges, indicating numerous large-angle grain boundaries and severe local misorientation, in particular at grain boundaries[51]. Fig. 6(d)  shows fan-shaped patterns appeared at the area blocked as zone I in Fig. 6(c) , in which angular faceted steps, river-pattern markings and tear ridges are clearly visible. While as shown in Fig. 6(e) , appearance of zone II in Fig. 6(c)  shows indentation-marks-like tongues patterns, revealing the events of mechanically twinning during compressive deformation. Additionally, the patterns of shallow-step type are present in the area of zone III in Fig. 6(c) , as displayed in Fig. 6(f) . In general, these fracture morphologies suggest that the primary failure mode under loading was controlled by tensile stress instead of shear one, which was believed to be associated with the brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) behavior, assuming that the BDT temperature of such bcc metals is above room temperature[27]. The tear ridges and mechanical twins in the surface are supposed to be responsible for the limited macroscopic plasticity which is evident as specimen barreling shown in Fig. 5 . Moreover, it is worthy to mention that fracture mode of the current TiZrNbTaMo HEA is generally similar to the scenario of the Ta20Nb20W20Mo20V20and Ta25Nb25W25Mo25HEAs[27]. Further studies are necessary to justify whether such a fracture mode was operated by the mechanism that pre-existing microcracks in the bulk grew, mutually interacted and led to final axial splitting, as suggested by Ashby et al.[52].","['f0025', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0030', 'f0025']",[]
3.4,Results.Potentiodynamic polarization behavior in PBS," Fig. 7 illustrates a group of potentiodynamic polarization curves for the as-cast TiZrNbTaMo HEA in PBS solution at 37°C under deaerated conditions, together with those of the Ti6Al4V, 316L SS and CoCrMo (Co28Cr6Mo) alloys under identical test conditions for comparison[42]. The electrochemical properties of these materials are listed in Table 4 , including the corrosion potential,Ecorr(defined as the potential at which the current changed sign from the cathodic to the anodic during potential sweep), passive current density,ipass(determined at the 0VSCE), and pitting potential,Epit(defined as the potential at which current density rapidly increased). As noticed, spontaneous passive behavior in the anodic branch took place in all cases. For these spontaneous passive metals, theipassandEpitare usually used as indicators to assess the corrosion resistance. As shown in Fig. 7 , the TiZrNbTaMo HEA exhibited an extensive passive plateau up to 1.2VSCEin the curve, without the occurrence of pitting corrosion and transpassivation. Such a response was substantially similar to the case of the Ti6Al4V, besides more positiveEcorrand slightly higheripassof the Ti6Al4V.These findings indicate that the corrosion resistance of the TiZrNbTaMo HEA under PBS condition, characterized by passivation and no pitting, is very comparable to the behavior of Ti6Al4V alloy.","['f0035', 'f0035']",['t0020']
3.4,Results.Potentiodynamic polarization behavior in PBS,"In contrast, polarization curve of the 316L SS and CoCrMo alloys was markedly distinct from that of the TiZrNbTaMo HEA, as illustrated in Fig. 7 . It was shown that theipassof 316L SS and CoCrMo were comparable to or one-half of that of the TiZrNbTaMo HEA. However, the current density rapidly increased when the applied potential reached up to above 675mVSCEfor 316L SS and 435mVSCEfor CoCrMo, reflecting the occurrence of pitting events in both cases. In a view of the implants in service, the pitting sites are very detrimental since they are potential sources for cracking and metal ion releasing. In this sense, pitting resistance of the TiZrNbTaMo HEA under physiological medium is remarkably superior to that of the 316L SS and CoCrMo alloys.",['f0035'],[]
4.1,Discussions.Validity of empirical approach for phase formation prediction,"Under a general thermodynamic frame, HEAs are expected to generate the high entropy effect which enhances the formation of solid-solution phases and overwhelms the intermetallic phases[53]. In multicomponent systems with less heats of mixing (ΔHmix) between unlike atomic pairs, the entropy (ΔSmix) part in Gibbs free energy (ΔGmix) becomes possible to compete with the ΔHmix, and then to favor the formation of simple solid-solution phase[26,28,54], while a large ΔHmixmay favor to form more than two phases, even ordered intermetallics[55–57]. Then, the emergence of HEAs opens new questions regarding the mechanism of their phase stability and the approach to screen composition for single solid-solution phase formation.",[],[]
4.1,Discussions.Validity of empirical approach for phase formation prediction,"Regarding these aspects, several semi-empirical approaches were proposed to wander predicting the phase stability in HEAs. In most cases, they were established on the basis of classic Hume-Rothery rules for the situation of conventional terminal solid solution. Zhang et al.[58]defined the atomic-size difference,δ, and parameterΩ, that is the ΔSmixtiming the average melting temperature of the elements over the ΔHmix, used for predicting the phase formation in multi-principal-component systems. It was claimed that the conditions ofδ≤6.6% andΩ≥1.1 are required to form stable solid-solution phases. In our case of the TiZrNbTaMo HEA, the values ofδandΩwere calculated to be 4.38% and 19.77, respectively, which approximately satisfied with this criterion for the formation of solid-solution phase. Guo et al.[59]proposed that the valence electron concentration (VEC) can be used as an indicator to assess the phase stability of either fcc or bcc solid solutions in the HEA system. The fcc solid-solution phases were suggested to be more stable at higherVEC(≥8), whereas a lowVEC(<6.87) would stabilize the bcc solid solution phases. For the current TiZrNbTaMo HEA, the value ofVECis 4.8, which satisfied with the upper boundary of bcc case as they defined. In the light of these criteria, the TiZrNbTaMo HEA was expected to form a single solid-solution phase, but it seems more or less against our results showing dual bcc phases in the as-cast alloy. It is necessary to mention that the present arc-melted alloy is likely away from thermodynamic equilibrium state due to the rapid cooling, without the experience of long period annealing for atomic diffusion. As a result, phase selection at thermodynamic equilibrium state for the stoichiometric Ti20Zr20Nb20Ta20Mo20remains uncertain.",[],[]
4.1,Discussions.Validity of empirical approach for phase formation prediction,"Recently, a new approach based on first principles calculations was proposed as well[60]. To assess the stability of HEAs in terms of Gibbs free energies, it is obvious in multicomponent potential solid-solution forming alloys that the enthalpy of solid solution formation is relatively small, whereas the entropic contribution of ordered compounds is also faint in general. As such, as a first approximation, it is hopeful to justify the stability of competing phases only by using the contributions of solid-solution phases (-Tcrit⋅ΔSmix) and the enthalpy of formation of ordered compounds (ΔHf), under a condition beyond a critical temperature (Tcrit) below which atomic diffusion is extremely slow that the enthalpic driving force is insufficient to induce the decomposition of solid-solution phase at a realizable time scale. For the current TiZrNbTaMo HEA, its melting point,Tm, is estimated to be 2600K using the rule of mixture, and then theTcritis taken as 1400K in the light ofTcrit=0.55Tm. Then, the entropic contribution item is equivalent to the ΔHf=−199meV/atom, namely taken as the ΔHfof solid-solution phase, whereas the lowest ΔHfvalue of possible binaries between the alloy components is −193meV/atom at the Mo-Ta pair. In fact, these two competing factors are quite comparative. In other words, no one is predominant. Therefore, it is not surprising to finalize the multiple phases in the system, which is actually in accord with our experimental results.",[],[]
4.2,Discussions.Strengthening mechanism of HEA,"As indicated inSections 3.2and3.3, microhardness and yield strength of the TiZrNbTaMo HEA do not simply obey the rule of mixtures of the constituent elements properties. For comparison, Table 2 shows typical values of theHvandσyfor relevant elements in the alloy[61]. It is noteworthy that the real values of theHvandσyof the alloy are approximately five-fold in comparison with the data calculated by the rule of mixtures,Hvmix=∑ciHviandσymix=∑ciσyi, as shown in Table 2 . It is indicative of the contribution from solid solution-like strengthening in the current alloy.",[],"['t0010', 't0010']"
4.2,Discussions.Strengthening mechanism of HEA,"Assuming an ideal situation, the HEA forms a single bcc solid-solution phase, and then each atom in the phase is treated as a solute atom in the simplest terminated case, and randomly occupies the crystal lattice site if ignoring the possible atomic ordering or clustering. In such a case, mutual interactions between these solute atoms caused by mismatch either in sizes or in moduli can generate the elastic distortion of lattice, accompanied by local elastic stress fields. The interaction between the local elastic stress fields and the stress fields of dislocations during deformation has a power to hinder dislocation movements, and then strengthening the alloy, as defined assolid-solution strengthening effect[62].",[],[]
4.2,Discussions.Strengthening mechanism of HEA,"To examine the misfit effects in atomic size and modulus, a single-phase bcc HEA can be treated as pseudo-binary system in different ways[28]. As such, it is possible to rationalize the solid-solution strengthening effect based on Labusch approach. We applied the pseudo-binary picture to our TiZrNbTaMo alloy. With the data as shown in Table 5 , the atomic-size differences between Ti, Nb and Ta elements are tiny in the case of Ti15Zr10Nb20Ta31Mo24bcc1 phase. If these atoms couple with Mo atom, local tensile strain is produced (δai≈−0.011). On the contrary, the largest difference in size appears between Zr and rest components, which produce local compressive strain (δai≈0.096). To assess the contribution from lattice distortionΔσa, the bcc1 phase is treated as a pseudo-binary solid solution, defining the Ti, Nb, Ta and Mo as nominal solvents and 10at.% of Zr as solute. Accounting the average strain fields around Ti, Nb, Ta and Mo atoms as zero, the lattice distortion near Zr atoms is estimated to beδa≈0.107. Then, lattice distortion contribution is approximately quantified to beΔσa≈190MPa. Similarly, to gain the contribution of modulus misfitΔσG, the bcc1 phase is treated as an another type of pseudo-binary solid solution, in a way of the Ti, Zr, Nb and Ta as solvents and 24at.% of Mo as solute. The modulus misfit in the vicinity of Mo atoms is given to beδG≈0.668, and then the modulus misfit contribution is approximately quantified to beΔσG≈1556MPa. It is noted that theΔσGis about eight-foldΔσa. Here, the modulus misfit is defined asδG′ij=δGij/(1+|δGij|/2), since it was proven to be reasonable[63,64], rather than asδGijas previously used in Ref.[28]. As such, total contributions of atomic size and modulus misfits to yield strength of bcc1 phase are attained asσy1=(σy)mix+Δσa+ΔσG=259+190+1556=2005MPa. Evidently, major contributor to the strengthening originates from the modulus-misfit effect.",[],['t0025']
4.2,Discussions.Strengthening mechanism of HEA,"In parallel, such analysis is performed again to the Ti24Zr43Nb12Ta8Mo13bcc2 phase, with the data as displayed in Table 6 . For strengthening induced by atomic-size misfit, the Ti, Nb, Ta and Mo atoms are viewed as nominal solvents, while the 43at.% of Zr is as solute, then theδa≈0.107 andΔσa≈372MPa. While in the case of modulus misfit, the Ti, Zr, Nb and Ta atoms are treated as nominal solvents, and 13at.% of Mo as solute, then theδG≈0.837 andΔσG≈1032MPa. Total contributions of atomic size and modulus misfits to yield strength of bcc2 phase are integrated asσy2=(σy)mix+Δσa+ΔσG=264+372+1032=1668MPa, showing that the modulus misfit is the key player again.",[],['t0030']
4.2,Discussions.Strengthening mechanism of HEA,"Furthermore, yield strength of the alloy containing dual phases is achieved to beσy=φ1σy1+φ2σy2≈1900MPa, whereφ1andφ2are volume fraction of bcc1 and bcc2 phases, respectively. Note that this number is about 36% higher than the experimentally measured one of 1390MPa. For comparison, the calculated strength data of two refractory HEAs, the current TiZrNbTaMo and previously-reported TaNbHfZrTi[28], are shown in Table 7 . It is indicated that modulus misfit is actually responsible for more than half, typically even about 75%, of the total solid-solution hardening[65]. In other words, the solid-solution strengthening in these two HEAs is primarily caused by the modulus misfit between atoms, instead of the atomic size misfit. It should be emphasized that it still remains in argument whether the atomic size misfit had stronger effect on solid-solution strengthening in refractory bcc alloys[65–68]. It is interesting to note that the predicted strength of the current TiZrNbTaMo HEA manifests a large deviation from experimentally measured one, as shown in Table 7 . It is somewhat contrary to the case of Senkov's TaNbHfZrTi HEA showing a good agreement between both numbers. In this sense, such a finding reflects that the pseudo-binary picture seems not physically universal at least for the refractory bcc HEAs.",[],"['t0035', 't0035']"
4.3,Discussions.Advantages over the current orthopedic alloys,"As is well known, mechanical properties is a fundamental aspect for orthopedic material screening, because the replaced prostheses are subjected to complex loading conditions during life time[2]. In the currently clinical service, three representative metallic materials including the Ti6Al4V, 316L SS and CoCrMo alloys have been well established as the standard/control materials for developing new orthopedic implant alloys. Meanwhile, mechanical properties of these alloys are well documented[42]. The yield strength and Vickers hardness of the Ti6Al4V and the CoCrMo are comparative, at the level ofσy=860MPa andHv=3.62GPa, andσy=897MPa andHv=3.76GPa, respectively. In contrast, the 316L SS shows somewhat lower yield strength of 690MPa and hardness of 3.34GPa. In comparison with these alloys, the present TiZrNbTaMo HEA exhibits theσyof 1390MPa andHvof 4.9GPa, which are significantly higher than those of these alloys. These advantages in mechanical properties seem promising to enhance longevity of orthopedic implants if it is the case. Meanwhile, it should be emphasized that the present compressive strength was used only for preliminary material screening in spite that it is rarely used for comparisons between the implant materials. Subsequent studies on the tensile ductility and fracture toughness for TiZrNbTaMo-based HEA are on-going work.",[],[]
4.3,Discussions.Advantages over the current orthopedic alloys,"Furthermore, wear resistance is an additional critical issue in particular for the implant with bearing surface. In general consideration, higher Young's modulus of materials scales with better wear resistance, according to Hertz's contact mechanics[69]. In this regard, Young's modulus ofE=153GPa for the TiZrNbTaMo HEA is approximately 39% higher than that of the Ti6Al4V (E=110GPa), even if slightly lower than that of the 316L SS (E=210GPa) and the CoCrMo (E=230GPa). Thus, wear resistance of the TiZrNbTaMo HEA is expected to be potentially superior to that of titanium alloy, which needs to be confirmed in future work.",[],[]
4.3,Discussions.Advantages over the current orthopedic alloys,"Finally, from the biocompatibility perspective, great concern on corrosion resistance of the implant metals under corrosive physiological environment has been mandatory in all cases. The excellent corrosion resistance of the TiZrNbTaMo HEA in PBS, comparable to that of Ti6Al4V, renders for its potential excellent biocompatibility owing to the surface passivation and high stability insensitive to the pitting. The cytotoxicity assessment of the TiZrNbTaMo HEA is under study to confirm these expectations.",[],[]
5,Conclusions and outlook,"Combining the HEAs concept with property requirement for orthopedic implants, we used the equiatomic Ti20Zr20Nb20Ta20Mo20quinary alloy as starting point to screen the potential orthopedic-implant HEA. Based on preliminarily investigation on this alloy, several conclusions are drawn as follows:(i)The as-cast Ti20Zr20Nb20Ta20Mo20HEA structurally consisted of major bcc1 and minor bcc2 in fraction, without formation of intermetallic phases. Difference in melting temperature between constituent elements results in chemical microsegregation in some extent in the microstructures, ultimately forming the Ta- and Mo-rich bcc1 phase as dendrites of Ti15Zr10Nb20Ta31Mo24and the Ta- and Mo-depleted bcc2 phase resided at interdendritic regions as the Ti24Zr43Nb12Ta8Mo13. The lattice parameters of bcc1 and bcc2 solid-solution phases were determined to be 0.3310nm and 0.3379nm, respectively.(ii)As confirmed by nanoindentation tests, dominant bcc1 phase containing more refractory elements is somewhat harder and stiffer than minor bcc2 phase with less refractory elements, at the levels ofHv=6.4GPa andE=161GPa for bcc1 phase, andHv=5.7GPa andE=133GPa for bcc2 phase. In the average case, Vickers microhardness and Young's modulus of the as-cast TiZrNbTaMo HEA were 4.9GPa and 153GPa, respectively. Against the rule of mixtures, the alloying-induced hardening effect is remarkable. The strengthening mechanism of this solid-solution-like HEA was rationalized by virtue of Labusch approach, proving the major contributor responsible for strengthening is the modulus misfit effect.(iii)The TiZrNbTaMo HEA exhibits room-temperature compressive yield strength ofσy=1390±75MPa and apparent plastic strain ofεp≈6% prior to failure. Its fracture mode and fractography reveal its brittleness and limited plasticity under deformation. Even so, it initiates the future effort direction to improve the ductility and toughness of the TiZrNbTaMo-based HEAs chemically away from the equiatomic composition.(iv)Under PBS medium to simulate physiological environment, the TiZrNbTaMo HEA exhibits excellent corrosion resistance comparable to the Ti6Al4V alloy, and pitting resistance remarkably superior to the 316L SS and CoCrMo alloy. Characterization of chemical and physical features of passive oxide film on the alloy surface is on-going work.",[],[]
