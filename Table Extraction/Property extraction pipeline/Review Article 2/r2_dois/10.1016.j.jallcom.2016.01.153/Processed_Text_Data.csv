0,Abstract,"High entropy alloys (HEAs) are facing difficulties in balancing strength and ductility, and till now there is no satisfactory solution. In this paper, the CoCrFeNiNb0.25 HEA with good ductility was strengthened by a face centered cubic (FCC) precipitate after annealing heat treatment. When the CoCrFeNiNb0.25 HEA was annealed at 750 °C, a lath-shaped FCC precipitates with nano basket-weave microstructures appeared and distributed randomly in the proeutectic FCC phase. Due to the precipitation strengthening, the yield stress of the CoCrFeNiNb0.25 HEA almost doubled but its ductility was just slightly damaged.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Studies on high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have been prosperous for several years, and great progress has been made[1–4]. High strength accompanied with enough ductility is always a final aim of the design of HEAs. Up to now, the reported results are still unsatisfactory. For example, the as-cast VNbMoTaW[5]HEA only has a room temperature compressive fracture strain of 2.3%, while the room temperature tensile fracture strength of as-cast CoCrFeMnNi is lower than 600 MPa[6]. Extensive efforts have been made to improve the comprehensive performance of HEAs, such as high-pressure torsion hardening[7], dynamic aging[8], deformation strengthening[9–13]and thermal annealing[14–16].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"As an universal effective method to improve mechanical properties by precipitation strengthening, annealing is widely used in commercial aluminum alloys[17], steels[18]and superalloys[19]. Several reported results showed that there are also age hardening effects in HEAs such as Al0.5CoCrNiTi0.5[20], CoCrFeNiMo0.85[21]and Ni2CrFeMox[22]. The increasing hardness of these HEAs after annealed is due to the appearance of intermetallics such as σ and μ phases. Likewise, brittle intermetallics like Laves phase, B2 phase and δ phase also appeared in many HEAs[15]. However, these intermetallics, usually appearing and concentrating in interdendritic regions, are harmful to the ductility of HEAs. Very recently, Z.P. Lu et al.[23]found that nanosized coherent reinforcing phase can be obtained and extraordinary balanced tensile properties at room temperature were achieved mainly through precipitation strengthening. If a proper participate is found, the mechanical properties of HEAs will be greatly enhanced.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In this paper, a ductile FCC precipitate with nano basket-weave microstructures, which can strengthen the alloy without sacrificing its compressive ductility, was found in the CoCrFeNiNb0.25HEA. The eutectic CoCrFeNiNb0.25HEA has been found as a promising candidate for the development of high temperature alloys because of their good balance between strength and ductility[24,25]. The results revealed that the FCC precipitate can strongly strengthen the alloy but barely damage its ductility, which also provides a promising way for further strengthening the CoCrFeNiNb0.25alloy. Besides, it is the first report of FCC precipitation in HEAs.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"The alloy was prepared by the arc melting and copper mold casting method. Elements of Cr, Fe, Co, Ni and Nb with purity of 99.95% were used as raw materials. To ensure the homogeneity, alloys were melted five times with electromagnetic stirring and then solidified into a water-cooled copper hearth. The cast ingot was 60 mm in length and 10 mm in diameter. The samples were cut from the cast ingot and then annealed at temperatures of 600, 750, 900 and 1000 °C for 7 days and cooled in air condition, respectively. The crystal structures were characterized by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD Bruker D8 discover, using Co Kα radiation scanning from 25 to 125° at a scanning rate of 4°/min) and transmission electron microscope (TEM JEOL2100F). The microstructures were analyzed by scanning electron microscope (SEM SU6600) and the chemical compositions were analyzed by TEM energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS). The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) experiment was carried out by using a simultaneous thermal analyzer (NETZSCH STA 449C). The heating rate was fixed at 20 K/min from room temperature to 1200 °C. The hardness measurement was carried out with a Vickers hardness tester (HMV-T2) under a load of 1000 g for 15 s, where an average of five different points on each sample was used. Compressive property tests were carried out on ∅ 3 × 5 mm samples at room temperature using a materials testing machine (INSTRON 3382) with a strain rate of 1.6 × 10−3s−1. The three points bending tests were also carried on INSTRON 3382 materials testing machine with a loading rate of 1 mm/min and the samples were rectangular bars of 5 × 5 × 35 mm3in size. The span length of the three points bending test was 30 mm.",[],[]
3,Results and discussion,"Fig. 1shows the microstructures of the CoCrFeNiNb0.25alloy both at as-cast and annealed states. A lath-shaped phase occurred after annealed at 750 °C, as shown inFig. 1(c). It also shows that, the lath-shaped phase only occurred in the alloy annealed at 750 °C, while for the alloys annealed 600, 900 and 1000 °C, the features of hypo-eutectic structures are still kept. InFig. 1(c), four different preferred orientations for the lath-shaped phase precipitated from the proeutectic structure appeared. The average spacing between these precipitations is about 500 nm. The volume fraction of the lath-shaped phase is around 11.4%, while that of the eutectic structure is about 28.6%. The DSC test was carried out to determine the temperature range that the precipitation can exist, as shown inFig. 2. It can be found that the precipitation begins at 700 °C and ends at 900 °C, which is a rough range of the stability zone for the precipitate observed in our study. In the thermal treatment, the lath-shaped phase did not occur after long-time annealed at 900 °C, which is due to the quite slow precipitation dynamics at this temperature.","['fig1', 'fig1', 'fig1', 'fig2']",[]
3,Results and discussion,"Morphologies of the precipitates inFig. 1(c)are very similar to the TCP basket-weave microstructures in superalloys. In superalloys, the TCP basket-weave microstructures can strongly damage the mechanical properties of the alloys due to that the precipitated TCP phases are brittle[26–28]. Here the hardness and the compressive properties of the CoCrFeNiNb0.25alloy with precipitates show much different behavior from those superalloys with TCP phases.Fig. 3presents the unusual mechanical behaviors of the annealed alloy, where the ductility of the alloy does not decrease significantly with the large amount of precipitates.Fig. 3(a)shows the hardness of the alloys at as-cast and annealed states. It shows that the hardness of the alloy annealed at 750 °C is a bit higher than that of the as-cast alloy. The compressive stress–strain curves of alloys at different states are presented inFig. 3(b). It shows that, after annealed at 750 °C, the alloy has doubled its yield strength and its fracture strength is also enhanced to more than 2000 MPa. It should be noted that the compressive ductility of the alloy was barely sacrificed. To further identify the positive contribution of the lath-shaped precipitation to the mechanical properties, three-point bending tests were also conducted.Fig. 3(c)presents the load–displacement curves of the as-cast and annealed HEA. Both curves showed almost linear elastic deformation (region I) followed by plastic yielding (region II), illustrating that both the alloys possess quite good ductility. The flexural strength of the CoCrFeNiNb0.25HEA was enhanced after annealed. The strengthening effect in the CoCrFeNiNb0.25HEA by annealing is evident due to the appearance of the lath-shaped precipitation. The stabilization of hardness and strengthening effect caused by the lath-shaped phase revealed that the precipitates might not be a TCP phase. The crystal structure of the precipitation in CoCrFeNiNb0.25HEA need some further investigations.","['fig1', 'fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3', 'fig3']",[]
3,Results and discussion,"Fig. 4(a)shows the XRD patterns of alloys at as-cast and annealed states. It can be found that the as-cast alloy was composed of the (CrFe)(CoNi)Nb-type Laves phase and FCC phase, which agrees with the reported results[24,25]. All the XRD patterns of the annealed alloys were almost same with that of the as-cast one. However, the microstructures inFig. 1(c)indicates obviously precipitation after annealed at 750 °C. It is also almost impossible that the XRD test fails to detect the peaks of the lath-shaped phase, since the volume fraction of the lath-shaped phase is much larger than 5%. Therefore, there is only one possibility that the peaks of the lath-shaped phase in the XRD pattern overlap completely with that of the FCC phase or the Laves phase, which means that the lath-shaped phase is a FCC or Laves phase. Here, TEM was further used to identify the phases in the CoCrFeNiNb0.25HEA annealed at 750 °C.Fig. 4(b)shows the bright field images and diffraction patterns of the CoCrFeNiNb0.25HEA annealed at 750 °C. The bright field image shows that the alloy consists of three different phases: A phase, B phase and C phase as shown inFig. 4(b). The diffraction patterns show that the A phase has a FCC crystal structure, the B region has a hexagonal crystal structure, while the lath-shaped phase (marked as region C) also has a FCC crystal structure. The eutectic structure is composed of the FCC phase and the Laves phase. The EDX equipped on TEM was also used to measure chemical compositions of proeutectic FCC phase, lath-shaped FCC phase and HCP phase inFig. 4(b). The measured chemical compositions are shown inTable 1. The proeutectic FCC phase was composed of nearly equal molar Co, Cr, Fe and Ni with small amount of Nb as solute, while the HCP phase were rich in Nb element. The lath-shaped FCC phase has Nb content of 10%, which is much higher than that of the proeutectic phase but much smaller than that of the HCP phase. Combined with the TEM, XRD and mechanical properties analysis, it is clear that the lath-shaped precipitate is a FCC phase although its microstructure is similar to the TCP phase in superalloys.","['fig4', 'fig1', 'fig4', 'fig4', 'fig4']",['tbl1']
3,Results and discussion,"The phase analyses indicate that a precipitate with FCC crystal structures was found for the first time in HEAs. Fortunately, the FCC precipitate benefited the strength of the CoCrFeNiNb0.25alloy extensively without sacrificing compressive ductility. The enhanced compressive and flexural properties with the lath-shaped phase come from its FCC crystal structure, which is plastic in nature without damage to the ductility of the alloy. Meanwhile, the interface between the lath-shaped phase and the proeutectic phase would inhibit the movement of dislocation, resulting in the strengthening effect on the mechanical properties.",[],[]
4,Conclusions,"In summary, a FCC precipitated phase was found in HEA of CoCrFeNiNb0.25. It comes from the proeutectic FCC solution after annealed at 750 °C and can strengthen the CoCrFeNiNb0.25HEA remarkably without sacrificing compressive ductility. Compared with that of the as-cast alloy, the yield strength of the alloy annealed at 750 °C was doubled but its compressive ductility almost kept unchanged. The three-point bending test verified that the annealed alloys with FCC precipitates possess quite good ductility. The strengthening effect in the CoCrFeNiNb0.25HEA by annealing is due to the existence of the ductile FCC precipitate.",[],[]
