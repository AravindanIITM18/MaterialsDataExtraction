0,Abstract,"The AlCoCrFeNiZr                        x                      alloys are produced by electric arc melting and their microstructure and mechanical properties were analyzed. The alloys present two types of microstructures. One is a periodic structure consisting of the ordered BCC phase and BCC solid solution phase caused by spinodal decomposition, and the other is a mixture of the ordered BCC phase and Laves phase which nucleate and grow alternatively. The coexistence of ordering and spinodal decomposition can be attributed to the lattice strain caused by the addition of Zr element with a large atom radius. The criteria (ΔHmix and ΔR) cannot effectively predict the phases for the AlCoCrFeNiZr                        x                      alloys and the Laves phase even appears in the AlCoCrFeNiZr0.008 alloy. The compressive test shows that minor Zr addition can significantly improve the mechanical properties. The AlCoCrFeNiZr0.008 alloy has the yield strength of 1560MPa, fracture strength of 3513MPa and plastic strain of 29.5%, which are increased by 240MPa, 843MPa and 7% compared with the AlCoCrFeNi alloy, respectively. However, when the Zr content is above 0.1, the fracture strength and plastic strain decrease significantly although the yield strength of the alloys increases with the Zr content further increasing.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High entropy alloys (HEAs), a new type of materials, have received considerable attentions in the material science community in past years[1–15]. This alloy design strategy is quite different from traditional alloys. In the traditional alloys, one or two elements are principal elements, and other minor elements are used to further optimize their properties. However, HEAs have at least five principal elements[16–18]. The alloys are named “HEAs” because their liquid or random solid states have high configurational entropy. HEAs often exhibit excellent mechanical properties, such as high strength, good ductility and wear resistance, due to the sluggish diffusion, severe lattice distortion and absence of intermetallic phases[17]. Subsequently, a number of investigations have been made to design new alloy compositions with promising mechanical properties[18–23].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In the previous studies, AlxCoCrFeNi (xvalue of molar ratio) is a wide investigated system because it has a wide range of microstructures and properties as the aluminum concentration changes[17]. To further tailor the microstructure and properties, the effects of alloying elements such as Nb[24], Ti[25], Mo[26]and Si[27], were studied. It is reported that the addition of Nb, Mo and Si alloying elements leads to the substantial increase in the yield strength, and the significant decrease in the plastic strain. Compared with the AlCoCrFeNi HEA, where the yield strength, fracture strength and plastic strain are 1500MPa, 2830MPa and 26.9%, respectively, 0.5 Ti addition increases significantly the compressive yield strength and fracture strength, which are 2260MPa and 3140MPa, respectively, and the plastic strain (23.3%) decreases slightly. In the present work, the AlCoCrFeNi alloy was still selected as the base alloy and Zr was chosen as the alloying element based on the following reasons. Firstly, the alloying element Ti can significantly improve the mechanical properties of the AlCoCrFeNi HEA. Both Zr and Ti elements have some similar physical characteristics, such as same crystal structure (HCP), high melting temperature and good corrosion resistance. Secondly, negative enthalpies of mixing and radius difference of constituent elements play dominant roles in controlling the phase selection in HEAs[17]. In the previous studies[24–27], alloying elements and other principal elements in HEAs have relative low negative enthalpies of mixing and radius difference. The Zr element has a larger negative enthalpy of mixing (i.e., the value of Zr–Al, Zr–Co, Zr–Cr, Zr–Fe, Zr–Ni atomic pairs is −44, −41, −12, −25 and −49kJ/mol, respectively[28]) and the atomic size of Zr element is much larger than that of the other constituent elements[29]. Consequently, it can get better understanding of the phase selection mechanism in HEAs and provide some new clues to the design of the alloys with excellent properties by means of the microstructure characterization and property test of AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"The AlCoCrFeNiZrxingots (x=0, 0.008, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.5) were prepared by arc melting pure elements with more than 99.9wt.% purity under Ti-gettered high purity argon atmosphere on a water-cooled Cu crucible, and the alloys were denoted as Zr0, Zr0.008, Zr0.05, Zr0.1, Zr0.2, Zr0.3 and Zr0.5, respectively. The alloys were re-melted at least five times for homogeneity. The samples were taken from the as-cast ingots. After polishing mechanically, the microstructure was characterized by a FEI Quanta-400F scanning electron microscope (SEM) operated at back-scatter electron (BSE) mode. The chemical compositions were analyzed by an Oxford Inca X-Max energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS), and the crystal structure was characterized by a LabX XRD-6000 X-ray diffraction (XRD) with the 2θ ranging from 20° to 100° at a speed of 0.2°/min. The rectangular compressive specimens with the dimensions of 7×5×5mm3were taken from the as-cast ingots and the compressive tests were conducted at an initial strain rate of 10−3s−1. The fracture morphology of compressive samples was examined by SEM operated at the secondary electron mode.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.XRD diffraction analysis," Fig. 1 shows the XRD patterns of the as-cast AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys. As seen from Fig. 1 , the Zr0 alloy exhibits the reflections of BCC solid solution. From the strongest peak (110) of Zr0, the lattice parameter of BCC solid solution is estimated to be 0.2912nm, which is similar to the result reported by Ma et al.[29]. Fig. 2 is the detailed scans for the peak (110) of BCC solid solution phase for the AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys, but no peak (110) of Zr0.05 and Zr0.5 alloys presents in Fig. 2 , since their peak locations are difficultly determined (see Fig. 1 ). From Fig. 2 , it can be seen that the peak (110) shifts to lower 2θ when the Zr concentration increases. This suggests that the lattice constant of BCC solid solution phase increases. It is confirmed that Zr can be partly dissolved into the AlCoCrFeNi HEA although the Zr element has a very negative enthalpy of mixing and large atomic size difference with the other constituent elements (see Table 1 and Table 2 ).","['f0005', 'f0005', 'f0010', 'f0010', 'f0005', 'f0010']","['t0005', 't0010']"
3.1,Results and discussion.XRD diffraction analysis,"In addition to the shift of diffraction peak of BCC solid solution phase caused by the dissolution of Zr element into the AlCoCrFeNi HEA, some diffraction peaks corresponding to new phases can also be observed in the AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys (see Fig. 1 ). When the concentration of Zr element is low andx=0.008, the peak around 30.7° occurs, indicating the appearance of a small quantity of ordered BCC phase. When the Zr content is 0.05, the reflections corresponding to the Laves phase present, which can be identified as ZrX2(X=Co or Ni) with the space group Fd3̅m (no. 227). It is learnt from Fig. 1 that the intensity of the Laves phase is much lower than that of the BCC solid solution phase in the Zr0.05 alloy, suggesting that the main phase is still the BCC solid solution and its formation is easier than ordered intermetallics during solidification process due to the high-entropy effect[30]. With the Zr concentration further increasing, the relative intensity of the BCC solid solution diffraction peaks reduces while the Laves diffraction peaks enhance, indicating the volume fraction of the Laves phase increases with the increase of Zr concentration.","['f0005', 'f0005']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Microstructures," Fig. 3 displays the SEM BSE images of the as-cast AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys. As seen from Fig. 3 a, the Zr0 alloy exhibits a single-phase feature. For the Zr0.008 alloy, the Laves phase can be observed at the grain boundaries of BCC phase (as marked by the arrow in Fig. 3 b), though the Laves phase does not present in XRD patterns of the alloys with the content of Zr element less than 0.05 due to its small amount. The volume fraction of Laves phase increases evidently with the increase of Zr concentration ( Fig. 3 b–e). When the Zr content is above 0.3, the Laves phase becomes the main phase. Furthermore, the morphology of BCC phase becomes dendrite ( Fig. 3 d-e).","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Microstructures," Fig. 3 f–kshows the detailed SEM BSE images of the alloys. As learnt from Fig. 3 f–k, there are two regions in the AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys: one contains Laves phase and the other has no Laves phase. For the regions without Laves phase, the structure consists of periodic brighter and darker phases. With the increase of Zr content from 0.05 to 0.3, the width of the periodic structure coarsens significantly especially close to the interfaces between the regions with Laves phase and without Laves phase (as marked by arrow in Fig. 3 g–h), while the periodic structure refines again with the Zr content further increasing. Since the AlCoCrFeNiZr0.3alloy has the largest width of the periodic structure, it is used to analyze chemical composition of different phases, and the EDS results are given in Table 3 and Fig. 4 . As seen from Table 3 and Fig. 4 , it is difficult to detect Zr element in the regions without Laves phase. The darker phase in the regions without Laves phase is rich in Al, Ni, while the lighter phase is rich in Fe, Cr, with Co evenly distributed. It suggests that the Zr addition results in the spinodal decomposition[32–33]. For the regions with Laves phase, the structure is a mixture of the BCC phase and Laves phase which nucleate and grow alternatively (see Fig. 3 f-k). As learnt from Table 3 , the chemical composition of darker phase in the regions with Laves phase is similar to that of Al- and Ni-rich phase (ordered BCC phase) formed by spinodal decomposition, but it should be noted that the Zr element can be detected in the darker phase in the regions with Laves phase.","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0020', 'f0020', 'f0015']","['t0015', 't0015', 't0015']"
3.2,Results and discussion.Microstructures,"In the previous studies on HEAs, little work found the coexistence of ordering and spinodal decomposition. The intermetallic compounds present in AlCoCrFeNiNbx[24], AlCoCrFeNiTix[25], AlCrFeNiMox[26], AlCoCrFeNiSix[27]and CoCrFeNiNbx[34]alloys, while the spinodal decomposition occurs in AlCoCrFeNiVx[35]alloys. In the present work, it is interesting to find the coexisting of ordering (Laves phase) and spinodal decomposition in the AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys. This can be attributed to the large lattice strain caused by the large difference of atomic size, since elastic interactions with long range order have a dual effect by promoting ordering and spinodal decomposition concomitantly[36]and the Zr atomic size is much larger than that of the other elements in the AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys (see Table 2 ).",[],['t0010']
3.2,Results and discussion.Microstructures,"Based on the previous experimental works on HEAs, both the mixing enthalpy ΔHmixand atomic size difference ΔR are found to play dominant roles in controlling the phase selection in HEAs. For the current AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys, ΔHmixand ΔR are listed in Table 4 and calculated as[5,24,29]:(1)ΔR=∑i=1nCi1−Ri/∑i=1nCiRi(2)ΔHmix=∑i=1n4ΔHijmixCiCjwhere N is the number of the components in alloys,CiandCjare the atomic percentages ofith andjth,Riis the atomic radius ofith element, respectively, and ΔHmixijis the mixing enthalpy of binary alloys.",[],['t0020']
3.2,Results and discussion.Microstructures,"Previous results indicate that the formation of solid solution in HEAs is beneficial in the regions of −15kJ/mol<ΔHmix<5kJ/mol and ΔR<6.6%[16,30,32]. When the Zr content in the AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys is less than 0.2, ΔHmixand ΔR are above −15kJ/mol and less than 6.6%, respectively (see Table 4 ). It suggests that the alloys with less than 0.2 Zr should have a single solid solution phase. However, the Laves phase even appears in the Zr0.008 alloy. This indicates that the criteria (ΔHmixand ΔR) cannot effectively predict the phases for the current AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys. Actually, ΔHmixis an essentially averaged factor (see Eq.(1)). It can reasonably reflect the overall chemical attraction of an alloy system, but cannot sensitively reflect the contribution from the mixing enthalpy ΔHmixijbetween the constituent atomic pairs. Mixing enthalpy ΔHmixijreflects the driving force for the formation of stable intermetallic compounds[32]. Thus, the intermetallic compounds can also form if the atomic pairs have a large negative mixing enthalpy ΔHmixij(the mixing enthalpies of Zr with Al, Co and Ni elements are −44kJ/mol, −41kJ/mol and −49kJ/mol, respectively), although the total mixing enthalpy ΔHmixof the alloys is still located in the regions of −15J/mol<ΔHmix<5kJ/mol. Furthermore, the Zr atom radius is much larger than that of other constituent elements in the AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys. The dissolution of the Zr element into the alloys is expected to produce large lattice distortion energy, which can destabilize the BCC solid solution and promote the formation of the Zr-rich Laves phase.",['fo0005'],['t0020']
3.3,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties," Fig. 5 is the compressive engineering stress–strain curves of AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys. The yield strengthσy, fracture strengthσband plastic strainεpare shown in Fig. 6 . For the Zr0 (AlCoCrFeNi) alloy, the yield strength, fracture strength and plastic strain are 1320MPa, 2670MPa and 22.5%, respectively, which reduce slightly compared with the results reported by Dong et al.[37]and Zhou et al.[25]. Dong et al.[37]reported that the yield strength, fracture strength and plastic strain of AlCoCrFeNi alloy are 1379MPa, 2865MPa and 22.7%, respectively, while Zhou et al.[25]results show that the yield strength, fracture strength and plastic strain of AlCoCrFeNi alloy are 1500MPa, 2830MPa and 26.9%, respectively. This should be attributed to the difference of the cooling rate during solidification process. Wang et al.[38]found that the compressive properties of AlCoCrFeNi alloy decrease significantly when the diameter of suction casting cylindrical rods changes from 2mm to 10mm. For the sample with a diameter of 2mm, the yield strength, fracture strength and plastic strain are 1425MPa, 2920MPa and 31.7%, respectively. For the sample with a diameter of 10mm, the yield strength, fracture strength and plastic strain are 1258MPa, 1830MPa and 11.7%, respectively.","['f0025', 'f0030']",[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties,"Although the increase of cooling rate during solidification process can improve the mechanical properties of the AlCoCrFeNi alloy, it is difficult to obtain such a high cooling rate for suction cast cylindrical rods with the diameter of 2mm in the industrial production. In the present work, although the cooling rate is low since the compressive samples were taken from the ingots solidified in the water-cooled copper crucible, minor Zr addition significantly increases the mechanical properties of AlCoCrFeNi alloy. The Zr0.008 alloy has the yield strength of 1560MPa, fracture strength of 3513MPa and plastic strain of 29.5% ( Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 ), which are increased by 240MPa, 843MPa and 7% compared with the Zr0 alloy, respectively. It is interesting to find that the strength of the Zr0.008 alloy is still much larger than that of the sample with the highest cooling rate (a diameter of 2mm) in the work of Wang et al.[38], and the plastic strain (29.5%) is close to that of the sample (31.7%). However, it should be mentioned that when the Zr content is above 0.1, the plastic strain and compressive strength decrease although the yield strength increases with the increase of Zr content.","['f0025', 'f0030']",[]
3.3,Results and discussion.Mechanical properties," Fig. 7 shows the fracture morphologies of AlCoCrFeNiZrxalloys. At low magnification, the fracture morphologies for the alloys with less than 0.1 Zr are mainly composed of radial herringbone patterns, see Fig. 7 a–c. At high magnification, the tear edges can be observed clearly, see Fig. 7 d–e. This suggests that the fracture mechanism of the alloys is quasi-cleavage fracture. For the Zr0.008 alloy, the slip features also appear in the magnified fracture images besides the tear edges ( Fig. 7 f). It is further confirmed that the Zr0.008 alloy has better plasticity than that without Zr addition since the slip features are the typical mechanism of plastic fracture under compression[39–41]. When the Zr content is above 0.1, the fracture morphologies are composed of flat fracture patterns caused by completely brittle fracture (as marked by the circle in Fig. 7 g) and radial herringbone patterns. As learnt from Fig. 7 g and Fig. 7 k, the area faction of flat fracture patterns on the fracture surface increases with the increase of Zr content. Fig. 7 h shows the detail fracture morphology of flat fracture patterns. As seen from Fig. 7 h, a fragile and block-stacking fracture appears, which corresponds to the regions consisting of alternating ordered BCC phase and Laves phase.","['f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035', 'f0035']",[]
