fig1,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.10.014/figures/egi10SL0HFM7PJ.jpg,Fig. 1,"Representative room-temperature stress-strain curves showing negligible effect of strain rate on the flow curves of the CrMnFeCoNi high-entropy alloy. Repeated load relaxation tests (duration 30 s each) were performed at various applied stresses along the true stress-strain curves. The magnified inset shows two such sets performed at comparable flow stresses (∼407–410 MPa) at strain rates of 10−3s−1(red curve) and 10−5s−1(black curve).

fig3,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.10.014/figures/egi10P5QXK1TJJ.jpg,Fig. 3,"Yield stressσyas a function of temperatureT. Black data points represent experimental results obtained here for a CrMnFeCoNi HEA with a mean grain sized= 17 μm. Blue points are calculated yield stresses for an infinite grain size using the Hall-Petch parameters reported by Otto et al.[16], and thus reflect the lattice strength including solid solution strengthening. Green and red points were calculated using the solid solution strengthening model discussed in section3for line tension parametersγ= 0.123 and 0.0625, respectively.

The error bars represent the experimental scatter at 293 K, ± 5%, obtained from tests performed at two different strain rates (Fig. 1); the same scatter is assumed for the remaining temperatures."

Black symbols are experimental data while green and red symbols were calculated using the solid solution strengthening model developed in section3for line tension parametersγ= 0.123 and 0.0625, respectively.
