0,Abstract,"We report on a study of the design, phase formation, microstructure, mechanical behavior and strengthening mechanisms of a novel single-phase Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5 (at.%) high-entropy alloy (HEA). In this investigation, a bulk nanocrystalline (nc) Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5 HEA with the face-centered cubic (FCC) crystal structure was fabricated by mechanical alloying (MA) followed by consolidation via spark plasma sintering (SPS). The X-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) results revealed that a single FCC solid-solution phase with an average grain diameter of 24 nm was produced following MA. Following SPS, bulk samples exhibiting a bimodal microstructure with both nanoscale grains and ultra-fine grains (UFGs) and with an average grain diameter of 95 nm were obtained, possessing a single FCC solid-solution phase identical to that in the milled powders. The single-phase feature of the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5 HEA principally resulted from remarkably high mutual solubility in most binary atom-pairs of the constituent elements, which appears to correspond to a high entropy of mixing. Approximately 5 vol.% of nanoscale twins were observed in the bulk nc samples. The bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5 HEA exhibits a compressive yield strength of 1795 MPa with a hardness of 454 Hv, which is dramatically higher than the yield strength of most previously reported FCC structured HEAs (∼130–700 MPa). Compared to those of the bulk coarse-grained (CG) Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5 HEA fabricated by arc-melting, the yield strength and Vickers hardness values of the bulk nc samples increased by 834.9% and 251.9%, respectively. Quantitative calculations of the respective contributions from each strengthening mechanism demonstrate that grain boundary strengthening and dislocation strengthening are principally responsible for the measured ultra-high strength of the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5 HEA.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In 2004, Yeh et al. proposed a new class of multi-component alloys with equal or nearly equal atomic concentrations for each component and termed them as high-entropy alloys (HEAs) or multi-principal-element alloys[1]. Originally HEAs were loosely defined as homogenous solid-solution alloys with body- or/and face-centered cubic (BCC or/and FCC) crystal structures, consisting of at least five principal-elements with 5–35 at.% concentrations for each element[1–3]. In recent studies, quaternary medium-entropy alloys have also been classified as HEAs[4–6], and a few hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structured HEAs have also been discovered[7–9]. Although HEAs typically contain multiple principal-elements with equal or nearly equal atomic concentrations, intermetallics or complex phases are generally absent in HEAs. In an HEA system, the free energy of mixing (ΔGmix) can be significantly reduced by a high entropy of mixing (ΔSmix) according to the equationΔGmix=ΔHmix−TΔSmix, and accordingly random solid-solution phases are favored compared to ordered phases[1–3].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Inspection of the HEA literature reveals three important findings. First, there are a substantial number of multi-phase HEAs that have been investigated. Second, when compared to multi-phase HEAs, single-phase HEAs are more consistent with the basic premise that a high entropy of mixing facilitates “mixing” and stabilizes a homogenous solid-solution. Third, in comparison with FCC structured HEAs, BCC structured HEAs often exhibit greater brittleness, albeit with higher strength since ordering usually takes place in BCC HEAs, and the BCC structure has a small number of close packed planes that can operate as glide planes for dislocations[2,3]. In view of these findings, we focused on FCC structured single-phase HEAs in the present work. In previous studies[10–21], reports of single FCC phase formation in HEAs were primarily based on X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns; however, different FCC phases possessing similar lattice parameters with different chemical compositions can lead to overlapping peaks in XRD patterns, resulting in the incorrect conclusion that only a single phase is present[3,21]. Therefore, reports on single FCC phase HEA systems require additional verification. Moreover, the currently proposed formation criterion for single-phase HEAs, i.e., a single FCC solid-solution phase can be formed when a valence electron concentration (VEC) ≥8.0 and a single BCC solid-solution phase is present whenVEC<6.87[22,23], is too narrow and under active discussion, and accordingly there are very few studies on true “single-phase HEAs” with FCC structure. It is important to note that the equi-atomic Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20(CoFeNiCrMn) represents a particularly intriguing HEA system that potentially has a single FCC phase. Formation of Cr-rich and/or Mn-rich phases may occur in this Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA producedviainduction melting followed by suction casting[5,24,25]; however, true single FCC phase can be attained under strict conditions, for example, fast enough cooling rates or appropriate annealing conditions[24]. Additionally, it has been reported that Fe40Mn27Ni26Co5Cr2and Fe40Mn40Co10Cr10HEAs designed on the basis of the equimolar Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA can steadily achieve true single FCC phase characteristics using conventional casting techniques[26,27]. However, if one adheres to the strict definition of HEAs containing at least five principal-elements with 5–35 at.% concentrations for each element, these two particular chemistries should not be classified as HEAs[1–3].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In terms of mechanical behavior, most of the previously reported FCC structured HEAs prepared by arc-melting exhibit a relatively low yield strength of ∼130–700 MPa, depending on the constituent elements[2,3,10–21]. The low strength has been attributed to the fact that solid-solution strengthening plays a key role in the mechanical behavior of coarse-grained (CG) FCC HEAs, and this strengthening mechanism is degraded by coherent phase separation as well as rendered ineffective by the small atomic size differences that characterize FCC HEAs[20].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In view of the above findings, the present study was motivated by the question of whether it is possible to design single-phase FCC HEAs with high strength by introducing strengthening mechanisms in addition to those that originate from a solid solution. Note that equiatomic Co20Ni20Fe20Cr20Mn20(CoNiFeCrMn) HEA represents a particularly interesting HEA system that potentially has a single FCC solid-solution phase[21]. On one hand, to avoid Mn-rich and/or Cr-rich phases in the CoFeNiCrMn HEA system, Cu replaces Mn based on similar values of atomic radius and electronegativity, and Al replaces Cr because its lager atomic radius can enhance solid-solution strengthening[2,3]. On the other hand, Cu-rich phases may form in HEAs with a high concentration of Cu, and moreover, a high concentration of Al usually results in the formation of BCC solid-solution phases or ordered phases[1,2,15,19]. These arguments support the strategy that relatively low concentrations of Cu and Al should be used to ensure that a HEA with a single FCC phase is produced. Accordingly, the approach used in this study is described as follows. First, on the basis of the arguments described above, we design an HEA with the composition Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5(CoNiFeAl0.3Cu0.7) based on the equiatomic Co20Ni20Fe20Cr20Mn20HEA that can attain a single FCC phase under common casting conditions, and confirm the presence of such a single FCC phase using XRD and diffraction in transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Second, we introduced a nanocrystalline (nc) grain size during processing in order to activate grain boundary (GB) strengthening as an operative mechanism[28–35].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"It is important to note that despite published studies on nc HEAs prepared using casting followed by high-pressure torsion (HPT)[25,36], and using mechanical alloying (MA)[6,37,38]followed by rapid sintering techniques such as spark plasma sintering (SPS)[28,39], fully dense bulk nc HEAs have rarely been studied. In our study, a bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA with a single FCC phase was fabricatedviaMA and SPS. The alloying response, microstructure, phase formation and evolution, and mechanical behavior of the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA were systematically investigated. Moreover, to provide insight into the strengthening mechanisms in FCC structured single-phase nc HEAs, the respective contribution from each strengthening mechanism was estimated to provide heretofore unavailable insight into the quantitative relationship between microstructure and mechanical behavior. For comparison purposes, bulk CG Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA preparedviaarc-melting was also investigated.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"Elemental powders of Co, Ni, Fe, Al and Cu with high purity (>99.7 wt.%) and particle sizes ≤45 μm (−325 mesh) were used as starting materials for processing bulk nc and CG Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5(at.%) samples. The bulk CG Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5samples were prepared by vacuum arc-melting in a high-purity argon (Ar) atmosphere. The Co, Ni, Fe, Al and Cu powders were blended for 12 h and subsequently the mixed powders were uniaxialy pressed into cylindrical specimens using a hydraulic press, with a compaction pressure of 400 MPa. Then the compacted pellets were melted in a water-cooled Cu mold in an Ar atmosphere. The as-cast samples were 20 mm in diameter and 15 mm in height. To improve chemical homogeneity, the ingots were re-melted a minimum of four times. The bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5samples were preparedviaMA followed by SPS. The MA was performed using a high-energy planetary ball-milling machine operated at 300 rpm. Tungsten carbide balls and as-received powders were placed in stainless-steel vials, with a ball-to-powder weight ratio of 10:1. The entire MA process was conducted in an Ar atmosphere. 45 h of dry milling without a process control agent (PCA) was first performed. Then 4 h of wet milling with ethanol as PCA was conducted from 45th to 49th h of milling. After the completion of milling, the powders milled for 49 h were dried, and the dried powders were allowed to pass through a 75 μm sieve. Subsequently, the sieved powders (≤75 μm) were consolidatedviaSPS using a Dr. Sinter 825 apparatus (Sumitomo Coal Mining Co. Ltd., Japan) at 1273 K, with a heating rate of 90 K min−1. During SPS, a constant pressure of 30 MPa was utilized and the vacuum pressure was maintained <8 Pa. Following SPS, samples with a diameter of 20 mm and height of ∼8 mm were obtained. Specimens for testing were sectioned by electrical discharge machining.",[],[]
2,Experimental procedures,"XRD analyses of powders and bulk samples were performed using a Bruker D8 ADVANCE X-ray diffractometer with a Cu Kα radiation. Microstructures and chemical compositions of the as-milled powders and bulk samples were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and TEM with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), as well as optical microscopy (OM). SEM was conducted utilizing a Zeiss Supra 40 (Carl Zeiss NTS GmbH, Germany). After TEM specimens were prepared by mechanical thinning followed by ion milling, they were observed using a JEOL JEM-2100 (200 kV) or a JEOL JEM-2500SE (200 kV) with selected area electron diffraction (SAED). Compression tests were carried out three times for each material ofΦ3 mm × 4.5 mm at ambient temperature, utilizing an Instron 5500 testing system. A strain rate of 1 × 10−3s−1was applied for the compression tests. A HVS–1000 digital micro-hardness tester was employed to measure the hardness of bulk samples, with a load of 2942 mN. The average hardness of each sample was obtained from 10 measurements at minimum.",[],[]
3.1,"Results.Microstructure, phase formation and phase composition","Fig. 1(a) shows the XRD patterns of mechanically alloyed Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA powders as a function of milling time. In the XRD pattern of the 0 h milled (as-blended) powders, peaks corresponding to all of the elemental components are evident. As the MA process proceeds, the intensities of the elemental constituent peaks decrease rapidly, suggesting the beginning of alloying. The peaks corresponding to Al essentially disappear after 6 h of milling, suggesting that Al exhibits the highest alloying rate in this quinary HEA system. After 15 h of milling, only the peaks corresponding to Ni and Fe are detected, and some peaks have shifted evidently, suggesting that Cu and Co have completely dissolved, forming a solid solution. Meanwhile, trace amounts of WC contaminant from the milling balls is observed with increasing milling time. As milling time increases to 30 h, most peaks corresponding to the constituent elements disappear, and peaks corresponding to a single solid-solution phase with an FCC structure are evident. The crystal structure of the solid-solution phase will be confirmed later by TEM. As milling time further increases to 45 h and 49 h, there are no other phases detected by XRD. In addition, peak broadening is evident as milling time increases.",['fig1'],[]

Hence, the nc grains and UFGs possess identical crystal structure. Considering that the nc grains and UFGs possess an identical FCC crystal structure and essentially the same chemical composition, they are essentially attributed to the same solid-solution phase, exhibiting different grain sizes.

4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and stability,"During MA, the alloying sequence for each element in the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA is consistent with the observation by Chen et al., that is, the alloying rates of constituent elements with the same concentrations are inversely proportional to their melting points[40]. For example, Al exhibits the highest alloying rate in this quinary HEA system, which is consistent with the fact that it possesses the lowest melting point and concentration[40]. It has been argued that an element with a lower melting point will have a higher intrinsic diffusion coefficient in the solid state[41]. When the constituent elements have similar melting points, such as Co and Ni, the alloying rates are basically proportional to the brittleness of the pure elements[40]. Furthermore, lowering the concentration of constituent element increases alloying rate[6]. Thus, the anticipated alloying sequence for the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA is: Al→Cu→Co→Ni→Fe, consistent with our experimental results. In addition, the evident peak broadening during the MA process is attributed to a reduction in crystallite size and increase in lattice strain[2,6]. As described in Section3.1, most elemental constituents disappeared and a single solid-solution phase with an FCC structure was formed in the milled powders after 30 h of milling. Based on the XRD and TEM results, the crystal structure, lattice parameter and chemical composition of the single solid-solution phase in the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA are essentially identical to those of the single solid-solution phase in the 49 h milled powders, suggesting the absence of phase transformations during SPS.",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and stability,"Yeh et al. explained the formation of HEAs with multiple-principal-elements, based on the entropy of mixing (ΔSmix)[1]. In a multi-component system, ΔSmixis approximately calculated by the following equation[1,2]:(1)ΔSmix=−R∑i=1n(cilnci)wherenrepresents the number of component elements,cirepresents the atomic percentage of theith component element, andRis the universal gas constant (8.314 JK−1mol−1). Initially, the value of ΔSmixwas assumed to be ≥ 13.38 JK–1mol−1in multi-component systems where HEA solid-solution phases could be formed[1–3]. High ΔSmixcan significantly lower the Gibbs free energy of mixing ΔGmix(ΔGmix= ΔHmix−TΔSmix, where ΔHmixis enthalpy of mixing), especially at high temperatures, resulting in “mixing”, i.e., the formation of solid-solution phases, rather than the formation of ordered intermetallic phases or other complex phases. However, sole consideration of the effect of high ΔSmixis not adequate to explain the formation of solid-solution phases in multi-component HEAs, since intermetallic phases or other complex phases have also been observed in some multi-component alloys with high ΔSmix[2,17,18]. This suggests that the entropy of mixing ΔSmixdoes not necessarily lead to a low Gibbs free energy of mixing ΔGmixin HEA systems.",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and stability,"In order to predict the formation of stable solid-solution phases in multi-component HEA systems, two empirical parameters, atomic size difference (δ) and the scaled ratio (Ω) of ΔSmixto ΔHmix, were proposed by Yang et al.[42]. When the two empirical parameters satisfy the condition ofΩ≥ 1.1 andδ≤ 6.6%, stable solid-solution phases are formed in multi-component HEA systems[42]. To date, solid-solution phases have been obtained in most of the reported HEAs satisfying the required value ofΩandδ, suggesting that these two empirical parameters can be used to predict the formation of solid-solution phases. These two empirical parameters are defined by the following equations[42]:(2)Ω=TmΔSmix|ΔHmix|(3)δ=∑i=1nci(1−ri/r¯)2whereTm=∑i=1nci(Tm)i, (Tm)iis the melting point of theith constituent element;ΔHmix=∑i=1,i≠jnΩijcicj,Ωijusually equals to4ΔHijmix, andΔHijmixis the enthalpy of mixing theith andjth components, calculated on the basis of Miedema macroscopic model for ideal binary liquid alloys which represents a simplifying assumption[42,43];r¯=∑i=1nciriis the average atomic radius, where∑i=1nci=1,andriis the atomic radius of theith component[42]. The values ofΔHijmixof different atom pairs for Co, Fe, Ni, Al and Cu are provided with the atomic radii inTable 3[43]. According to the equations above, the values of ΔHmix, ΔSmix,Tm,δandΩfor the investigated Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA were calculated as −0.68 kJ mol−1, 12.80 JK–1mol−1, 1633 K, 3.52% and 30.74, respectively. Note that the two parametersδandΩsatisfyΩ≥ 1.1 andδ≤ 6.6%, and according to the criterion proposed by Yang et al., a solid-solution phase should be formed in the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA after milling and SPS, which is consistent with our experimental results.",[],['tbl3']
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and stability,"In addition, the concept of a valence electron concentration (VEC) has been proposed to predict the crystal structures of solid-solution phases in HEAs[22,23]. For multi-component HEAs,VECis calculated byVEC=∑i=1nci(VEC)i,where(VEC)iis theVECof theith component element. Guo et al. discovered that a sole solid-solution phase with an FCC structure is formed whenVEC≥8, and both FCC and BCC structured solid-solution phases are formed when 6.87 ≤VEC< 8, whereas a single BCC solid-solution phase is present whenVEC<6.87[22]. The calculated value ofVECfor the studied Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA is 8.9, and according to the findings by Guo et al., a sole FCC solid-solution phase should be formed in the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA, which is consistent with the results obtained in our study.",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and stability,"In fact, the underlying mechanisms that govern the formation of a solid-solution in HEAs remains poorly understood. Evidently, a high entropy of mixing (high configurational entropy) is not singularly responsible for the formation of solid-solution phases. It should be noted that Ni–Co and Fe–Ni binary atom-pairs have extremely high solubility with each other, and that Co has a relatively high solubility in Fe. In addition, Fe50Ni50and Co50Ni50binary alloys can form single FCC solid-solution phases[5,43]. Accordingly, the presence of Co, Ni and Fe, which have similar atomic radii and electronegativity, favors the formation of a single FCC solid-solution phase[5,42,43]. This suggestion of a single FCC structure was confirmed by results obtained with an equi-atomic Fe33.33Ni33.33Co33.33alloy prepared by casting[5,44]. Furthermore, we prepared an equi-atomic Fe33.33Ni33.33Co33.33alloy (not shown here) with a single FCC solid-solution phase having a lattice parameter approaching to that of Cu using the same method as that for bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA, in the meantime, Ni and Cu exhibit a complete mutual solubility, providing support to the suggestion that a single FCC solid-solution phase tends to form in the Fe–Ni–Co–Cu system[2,3,42,43]. Al has a relatively high solubility in Cu and moreover, has similar affinity with Co, Ni and Fe which in principle appears to lead to a “high-entropy effect” that will promote “mixing”, i.e., the formation of a solid-solution phase[6,43]. On the basis of these arguments, a single FCC solid-solution phase is anticipated in the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA. Hence the intrinsic nature of constituent elements plays a key role in the formation of solid-solution phases especially in the formation of a single solid-solution phase. The high-entropy effect originates from the exceedingly high solubility in most binary atom-pairs of the constituent elements in HEA systems. Accordingly, it follows that in order to form a single-phase feature, adding equal or nearly equal atomic concentrations for each component elements that may attain a high entropy of mixing is not an optimal strategy.",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and stability,"Although a high temperature of 1273 K was applied during sintering, an average grain size of 95 nm was obtained in the bulk samples of the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA after SPS. Despite the short sintering time during SPS, significant grain growth usually takes place in most metals and alloys, which results from the enhanced mass transport due to combined effects of the high temperature, pressure and electric field/current[39,45]. During SPS, the limited grain growth that occurred, from 24 to 95 nm, suggests that the milled HEA powders and the SPS'ed samples possess a high thermal stability. As previously reported, sluggish diffusion in HEAs plays a crucial role in enhancing their thermal stability[46,47]. Sluggish diffusion in multicomponent HEAs is attributed to the following three factors[46,47]: (i) diffusion in HEAs requires many different types of atoms to diffuse cooperatively due to the presence of a variety of elements; (ii) atom migration is hindered by the additional strain in the lattice caused by the presence of different elements; (iii) normalized activation energies for diffusion are higher owing to the larger lattice potential energy (LPE) fluctuation in HEAs. In contrast to single-phase HEAs, the actual entropy of mixing is not that high in multi-phase HEAs, and thus the sluggish-diffusion effect is limited during SPS. Hence, the ultimate grain sizes achieved in multi-phase HEAs sintered by SPS are usually on the order of hundreds of nanometers[6].",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and stability,"A large amount of defects, such as vacancies, dislocations, stacking faults, twins, grain boundaries, etc., are generated during the MA process due to severe deformation conditions[48]. We calculated the dislocation densities (ρ) in the 49 h milled powders and SPS'ed nc samples using the following equation[28,49]:(4)ρ=23εdbwhered,εandbare crystallite diameter, microstrain and the Burgers vector, respectively.bequals to22a(ais the lattice parameter) for an FCC structure, and is calculated as ∼0.255 nm for the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA.dandεwere calculated from the XRD patterns of the samples, using the Williamson–Hall method[50]. The true XRD peak broadeningBof the 49 h milled powders and SPS'ed bulk nc samples were obtained after eliminating the instrumental contribution[28,51]. The relation amongB,dandεis given by the equation[28,50]:(5)BcosθB=Kλd+εsinθBwhereλis the wavelength of CuKαradiation (0.154 nm),Kis a constant (0.9), andθBrepresents the Bragg angle. Combining Eqs.(4) and (5), the values of dislocation density for the 49 h milled powders and SPS'ed bulk nc samples are calculated to be 1.5 × 1016and 2.7 × 1015m−2, respectively.Fig. 10(a) and (b) show dislocations in the 49 h milled Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA powders and dislocations in the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA, respectively, suggesting high dislocation densities. According to previous reports[28,48,52–56], high dislocation densities on the order of 1015or even 1016m−2are present in some FCC nanostructured metals/alloys processed by severe plastic deformation techniques including ball milling. Hence, it is reasonable that a high dislocation density is present in the 49 h milled powders and in the SPS'ed bulk samples. The Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA based on which the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA is designed has a low stacking-fault energy (SFE), and accordingly a low SFE is expected in the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA[25,27,46]. Because of the anticipated low SFE and high dislocation density of the 49 h milled powders, recrystallization occurs during SPS, which releases part of the strain energy introduced during MA and stored in the powders[57]. The dislocation density decreases by almost one order of magnitude following SPS.","['fig10', 'fd4', 'fd5']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and stability,"As described in Section3.1, nanoscale twins are observed in the SPS'ed nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA, suggesting that planar slip occurs in this system[57,58]. Deformation twinning has been reported in materials associated with low SFE processedviaMA and attributed in part to the severe plastic deformation conditions that are present[28,48,57]. Presence of deformation twins is anticipated in the 49 h milled powders, however, due to the small grain sizes and the anticipated extremely small twin thickness, and to the prevalence of moire fringes owing to the high dislocation density, it is challenging to identify the deformation twins in the milled powders by TEM. When exposed to high temperature during SPS process, migration of the twin boundaries of the deformation twins takes place, resulting in thickening of the twins[57]. In addition, because of the high temperature during SPS and the low SFE of the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA, annealing twins are likely to form during SPS[57,59]. Furthermore, annealing twins can be also generated during recrystallization[60]. Hence, twins in the sintered bulk Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA can be either deformation twins retained from milled powders or annealing twins created during SPS. The increase in grain size during SPS of milled Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA powders is attributed to grain boundary migration and recrystallization; the creation of UFGs is attributed to recrystallization.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Strengthening mechanisms,"As shown in Section3.2, the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA exhibits a yield strength of 1795 MPa in compression, which is higher than that reported for any bulk FCC HEAs.Fig. 9(a) indicates that strain-hardening is nearly absent in the SPS'ed nc samples, whereas significant strain-hardening is present in the as-cast CG samples. Strain-hardening in the CGs occurs due to the fact that dislocation glide is facilitated. Coarse grains in the as-cast CG samples have sufficient space for dislocation glide, and therefore the as-cast CG samples exhibit significant strain-hardening[28,61]. In contrast, nanoscale grains in the SPS'ed nc samples have very limited space for dislocation glide, leading to the extremely limited strain-hardening[61,62].",['fig9'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Strengthening mechanisms,"The strengthening mechanisms in the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA are now analyzed, and the respective quantitative contribution of each strengthening mechanism is estimated. Solid-solution strengthening (ΔσSS), dislocation strengthening (ΔσDis), GB strengthening (ΔσGB) and twin boundary (TB) strengthening (ΔσTB) are considered as strengthening mechanisms in the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5. It is important to note that contributions to strengthening from the WC contaminant were not considered because of its relatively low volume fraction.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Strengthening mechanisms,"The parameters needed here for the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA are not available in the literature since this alloy has heretofore never been studied, and therefore the corresponding parameters of the Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA based on which the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA is designed are used here as estimates. For the Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA, lattice frictionσ0is ∼125 MPa and the solid-solution strengthening caused by adding 7 at.% Al is ∼28 MPa[21,63]. Based on the reports of Liu et al. and Wu et al., the Hall–Petch coefficientKHP(CG)of the CG Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA is estimated as ∼0.6 MPa m−1/2[64,65]. In HEAs, solid-solution strengthening is primarily attributed to the atomic size difference from different types of atoms leading to increased lattice strain[2,46]. As shown inTable 3, the differences in atomic size are evident, with Al having the largest atomic radius in comparison with Fe, Ni, Co and Cu; therefore solid-solution strengthening can be principally attributed to Al in the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA. Accordingly, solid-solution strengthening in the Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA is estimated as ∼28 MPa.",[],['tbl3']
4.2,Discussion.Strengthening mechanisms,"Dislocation strengthening is calculated using ΔσDis=MαGbρ1/2, whereMandαare 3.06 and 0.2 for FCC metals, respectively[28,66]. As measured above, Burgers vectorband dislocation densityρare 0.255 nm and 2.7 × 1015m−2, respectively. The shear modulusGof the Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA is ∼74 GPa[67]. Thus, the calculated value for ΔσDisis ∼600 MPa.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Strengthening mechanisms,"Contribution from GB strengthening is calculated using ΔσGB=KHP(nc)d−1/2. The average grain diameterdof the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5is ∼95 nm. Note that for many pure metals, the Hall–Petch coefficient decreases with decreasing grain size; it decreases rapidly when the grain size approaches several nanometers[68]. Thus, the Hall–Petch coefficientsKHP(nc)of the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA or Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA are anticipated to be significantly smaller than those of their CG counterparts.KHP(nc)of the bulk nc Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA is not available in the literature. However, some studies[21,63,67]in the literature indicated that certain physical parameters for the Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA are similar to those for Fe-based alloys; for example,KHP(CG),σ0andGof the CG Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA are similar to those of pure Fe[69]. As pure Fe is refined from CG to nc,KHPdecreases from 0.6 MPa m−1/2–0.35 MPa m−1/2[69,70]. Thus, 0.35 MPa m−1/2is assumed to beKHP(nc)of the bulk nc Co20Fe20Ni20Cr20Mn20HEA, and accordingly this value is used asKHP(nc)of the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA to calculate the GB strengthening in the present study. The calculated value of ΔσGBis ∼1136 MPa.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Strengthening mechanisms,"The contribution from TBs to increasing the yield strength can be calculated by a Hall-Petch-type equation as follows[28,71–73],(6)ΔσTB=KTBλTB−12whereKTBis a constant approximately equal toKHP(nc), which is 0.35 MPa m−1/2[71–73], andλTBis the average TB spacing, i.e., the average twin thickness, which is ∼61 nm. It is important to note that Eq(6)assumes that twins are present in virtually 100 vol.% of the grains[71–73]. In the present study, however, the SPS processed nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA, contains a relatively low volume fraction of twins estimated to be ∼5%. Thus, the overall strength increment due to TB can be estimated using the equation below[28],(7)ΔσTB=VfTKTBλTB−12whereVfTrepresents the volume fraction of twins and is ∼5%. Therefore, the calculated value of ΔσTBis ∼71 MPa.",['fd6'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Strengthening mechanisms,"Evidently, in the nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA, the calculated values of the quantitative contributions from solid-solution strengthening, TB strengthening, dislocation strengthening and GB strengthening are 28, 71, 600 and 1136 MPa, respectively. Compared to dislocation strengthening and GB strengthening, solid-solution strengthening and TB strengthening appear to be negligible due to a negligible atomic size difference as well as to the relatively low volume fraction of twins. Thus, the ultra-high strength of the nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA is primarily attributable to GB strengthening and to dislocation strengthening, that is, these two strengthening mechanisms tremendously increase the strength over the as-cast CG Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA.",[],[]
5,Conclusions,"A Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA, which has not been reported previously in the literature, is designed. Bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA with an average grain diameter of 95 nm exhibiting an FCC structure was fabricated by MA followed by SPS. The 49 h milled powders exhibit a single FCC structured solid-solution phase with an average grain diameter of 24 nm. After SPS, the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA exhibits the same FCC solid-solution phase as the milled powders. The bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA primarily consist of nanoscale grains, with the number fraction of UFGs >200 nm in diameter being 7%. A small amount of twins with nanoscale twin lamella thickness are observed in some UFGs. The bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA exhibits an ultra-high compressive yield strength of 1795 MPa and a hardness of 454 Hv, which are higher than the corresponding values of any FCC HEAs reported in the literature. The yield strength and hardness of the bulk nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA are increased by 834.9% and 251.9%, respectively, compared to those of its as-cast CG counterpart. The quantitative contributions from each strengthening mechanism are estimated using available strengthening theories. The calculated values of the quantitative contributions from solid-solution strengthening, TB strengthening, dislocation strengthening and GB strengthening are 28, 71, 600 and 1136 MPa, respectively, suggesting that the ultra-high strength of the nc Co25Ni25Fe25Al7.5Cu17.5HEA is primarily attributed to GB strengthening and dislocation strengthening.",[],[]
