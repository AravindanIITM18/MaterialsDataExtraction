The values of mean grain sizesdmeanof all recrystallized samples are in micrometres. To determine the grain size from the EBSD data using a conventional mean-linear-intercept method, high angle grain boundaries with a misorientation angle ≥15° were defined as grain boundaries. The annealing twin boundaries were excluded from the grain size measurement, i.e. they were not counted as grain boundaries. EBSD: electron backscatter diffraction."

Strain distribution maps are obtained from digital image correlation (DIC). The distance of sample position from the fractured surface of each sample is displayed as 0–8 mm in DIC maps. The misorientation angle maps reveal the formation of mechanical twins (red) in the highly deformed microstructures of both the boron-doped and the undoped equiatomic samples.
