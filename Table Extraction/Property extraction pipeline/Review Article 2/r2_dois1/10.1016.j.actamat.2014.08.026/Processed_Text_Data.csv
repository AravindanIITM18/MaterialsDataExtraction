0,Abstract,"Compared to decades-old theories of strengthening in dilute solid solutions, the mechanical behavior of concentrated solid solutions is relatively poorly understood. A special subset of these materials includes alloys in which the constituent elements are present in equal atomic proportions, including the high-entropy alloys of recent interest. A unique characteristic of equiatomic alloys is the absence of “solvent” and “solute” atoms, resulting in a breakdown of the textbook picture of dislocations moving through a solvent lattice and encountering discrete solute obstacles. To clarify the mechanical behavior of this interesting new class of materials, we investigate here a family of equiatomic binary, ternary and quaternary alloys based on the elements Fe, Ni, Co, Cr and Mn that were previously shown to be single-phase face-centered cubic (fcc) solid solutions. The alloys were arc-melted, drop-cast, homogenized, cold-rolled and recrystallized to produce equiaxed microstructures with comparable grain sizes. Tensile tests were performed at an engineering strain rate of 10−3                     s−1 at temperatures in the range 77–673K. Unalloyed fcc Ni was processed similarly and tested for comparison. The flow stresses depend to varying degrees on temperature, with some (e.g. NiCoCr, NiCoCrMn and FeNiCoCr) exhibiting yield and ultimate strengths that increase strongly with decreasing temperature, while others (e.g. NiCo and Ni) exhibit very weak temperature dependencies. To better understand this behavior, the temperature dependencies of the yield strength and strain hardening were analyzed separately. Lattice friction appears to be the predominant component of the temperature-dependent yield stress, possibly because the Peierls barrier height decreases with increasing temperature due to a thermally induced increase of dislocation width. In the early stages of plastic flow (5–13% strain, depending on material), the temperature dependence of strain hardening is due mainly to the temperature dependence of the shear modulus. In all the equiatomic alloys, ductility and strength increase with decreasing temperature down to 77K.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Dissolved solute atoms, to varying degrees, affect the mechanical properties of metals. Conventional treatments of solid solution strengthening assume that dislocations move through a solvent lattice of like atoms and encounter discrete unlike atoms (solutes) that can affect their mobility. The simplest case to consider is the energetics of, and the force resulting from, the elastic interaction of a dislocation with the strain field of a single solute atom (e.g.[1–7]). Both atomic size misfit and modulus mismatch between the solute and solvent atoms can contribute to this interaction. In reality, however, a dislocation interacts with multiple solute atoms simultaneously, and the net force exerted by all the solute atoms needs to be considered. For dilute solutions, early theories assumed that the interaction force between the dislocation and the solute atoms is either the maximum value possible (strong obstacles lying exactly in the slip plane), or zero (obstacles lying above or below the slip plane)[8,9]. Taking into account the Friedel[10]separation between strong obstacles encountered by a dislocation, Fleischer developed a description in which the critical shear stress to overcome obstacles varied as the square root of the solute concentration, a result that was confirmed by early computer simulations[11,12]. For more concentrated solutions, Labusch[13–15]developed a statistical treatment of a dislocation moving through an array of obstacles with a distribution of interaction strengths, rather than the binary interaction assumed in Fleischer’s treatment, and obtained a critical shear stress that varied as the two-thirds power of solute concentration. Since the development of these early theories, there have been many refinements over the years (e.g.[16–21]).",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The picture of a dislocation moving through a solvent lattice and encountering discrete solute obstacles breaks down as the solute concentration and compositional complexity increase. Relatively little is known about the fundamental mechanisms of solid solution strengthening in compositionally complex alloys, i.e. alloys comprising multiple elements in high concentrations. An interesting subset of compositionally complex alloys is one in which the constituent elements are present in equal atomic concentrations. In such equiatomic alloys, there is no “solvent” or “solute” in the conventional sense. Therefore, rather than considering a dislocation moving through a solvent lattice and interacting with discrete solute atoms, it may be more appropriate to envisage the dislocation as moving through a mythical “average solvent” or “effective medium”. In other words, the equiatomic alloy may not be a simple extension or extrapolation from the dilute solution limits, but rather a distinct new state akin to a stoichiometric compound with fixed atomic ratios, albeit disordered.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In order to develop accurate effective medium theories of solid solution strengthening, it is desirable to experimentally characterize the mechanical behavior of a range of equiatomic solid solution alloys. To this end, we investigate here several equiatomic binary, ternary and quaternary alloys that were previously shown to be single-phase face-centered cubic (fcc)[22]. In addition, the alloys are all subsets of an equiatomic, quinary high-entropy alloy, FeNiCoCrMn, which is known to be a fcc-structured single-phase solid solution alloy[23–28]. Tensile tests showed that the yield and ultimate strengths of this high-entropy alloy increase as the temperature is decreased[24,26].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"The term high-entropy alloy (HE alloy) was coined by Yeh et al.[29]to denote alloys containing five or more elements in approximately equiatomic concentrations. These authors reasoned that the high configurational entropies of such alloys would stabilize the formation of a solid solution by counteracting the enthalpies of phase separation and compound formation. However, most of the so-called HE alloys discussed in the literature appear to be multi-phase alloys (e.g.[30–39]) whose configurational entropies, as pointed out by Otto et al.[27], should in fact be low rather than high. Apparently, there are only a few multi-element equiatomic alloys that are true single-phase solid solutions with fcc (e.g.[23–28]) or body-centered cubic (bcc) crystal structures (e.g.[40–42]). The configurational entropy of these single-phase alloys is likely to be high, approaching the value of the ideal mixture assumed in the analysis of Yeh et al.[29]. The present study of equiatomic binaries, ternaries and quaternaries aims to provide an experimental basis to understand the mechanical behavior of all equiatomic alloys, including the more complex HE alloys containing five or more elements.",[],[]
2.1,Experimental methods.Alloy preparation and characterization,"The equiatomic alloys listed in Table 1 were produced by arc melting the elements Fe, Ni, Co, Cr and Mn (>99.9% pure) in a water-cooled copper hearth under Ar atmosphere. All these alloys are single-phase, fcc solid solution alloys, as shown in an earlier paper[22], and all are subsets of the quinary, single-phase, fcc-structured, high-entropy alloy, FeNiCoCrMn[23–28]. For comparison, pure Ni was produced using the same process. When Mn was added as an alloying element, special care was taken in the processing because of its high vapor pressure and tendency to oxidize rapidly, as discussed elsewhere[22,24,26,27]. The arc-melted buttons were flipped and re-melted at least five times to promote thorough mixing and then drop-cast into copper molds to produce rectangular ingots measuring 12.7mm×25.4mm×127mm. The drop-cast ingots were homogenized for 24h at either 1373 or 1473K (see Table 1 ), followed by water quenching. They were then cold rolled along the longitudinal ingot direction to a total thickness reduction of 90–92% ( Table 1 ) without cross-rolling or intermediate annealing. Annealing studies were conducted on the rolled sheets to determine the temperatures and times that would yield fully recrystallized microstructures and comparable grain sizes (see Table 1 ). In addition, the grain size of one of the alloys (FeNiCoCr) was systematically varied to investigate its influence on mechanical behavior. The annealed samples were ground (through 800-grit SiC paper), polished (through 20nm colloidal silica suspension) and their microstructures examined in a JEOL 6500 scanning electron microscope operated in the back-scattered electron (BSE) mode.",[],"['t0005', 't0005', 't0005', 't0005']"
2.2,Experimental methods.Tensile tests,"Flat dog-bone-type specimens with a gage length of 10mm were cut from the cold-rolled sheets by electrical discharge machining (EDM) with their longitudinal axes perpendicular to the rolling direction. The specimens were annealed at the temperatures and times listed in Table 1 , and all faces of their gage sections ground through 600-grit SiC paper. Nine Vickers microhardness indents spaced 1mm apart were made along the specimen gage lengths using a LECO LM 100ATVickers Hardness tester with a force of 200g. Uniform elongations to fracture were calculated by averaging the change in the distance between adjacent indents, excluding the two indents on either side of the fracture plane.",[],['t0005']
2.2,Experimental methods.Tensile tests,"Tensile tests were performed with a screw-driven tensile testing machine (Instron) at an engineering strain rate of 10−3s−1and temperatures of 77, 203, 293, 473 and 673K. For the tests below room temperature, the specimens and grips were first fully immersed in a bath of liquid nitrogen (77K tests) or a dry ice plus ethanol mixture (203K tests) for ∼15min before starting the test. During the tests, the baths were topped off as needed to keep the specimen and grips fully immersed at all times. Room-temperature tests were performed in ordinary ambient air and those above room temperature in vacuum. Three nominally identical specimens of each alloy were tested at each temperature. X-ray diffraction (XRD) was performed on the gage sections of specimens tested at 77 and 673K to determine whether any phase transformation or second phase precipitation had occurred. No significant changes indicative of any phase transformations were observed on the XRD patterns. Fracture surfaces were examined in a JEOL JCM-5000 microscope operated at 10kV.",[],[]
2.3,"Experimental methods.Melting temperature, shear modulus and Poisson’s ratio measurements",The melting temperatures of the materials were measured using a NETZSCH 404 C differential scanning calorimeter (DSC). The melting point was determined during heating from room temperature as the start temperature of the endothermic melting peak observed on the DSC trace.,[],[]
2.3,"Experimental methods.Melting temperature, shear modulus and Poisson’s ratio measurements","To determine the room-temperature elastic constants, densities were first measured with an AccuPyc 1330 pycnometer. Right cylindrical samples (7mm length×6mm diameter) were cut from the homogenized ingots and ground through 600-grit SiC paper followed by compression to ∼3mm before being used for the density measurements. The purpose of this ∼60% compression was to close up any casting pores that may have been present. After density measurements, the samples were annealed at 900°C for 3h to produce fully recrystallized microstructures. The annealed samples were carefully ground, their thicknesses measured, and time of flight measurements made with appropriate acoustic transducers to obtain longitudinal and shear wave velocities. Assuming the recrystallized (polycrystalline) materials are isotropic, their two independent elastic constants were calculated from the longitudinal and shear wave velocities using techniques described elsewhere[43].",[],[]
2.3,"Experimental methods.Melting temperature, shear modulus and Poisson’s ratio measurements","The temperature dependence of the shear modulus of the FeNiCoCr alloy was measured using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) using a commercial RUS system (RUSpec®, Quasar International Inc., Albuquerque, NM, USA) with a tripod transducer configuration. To make the measurements, a cylindrical ingot of this alloy, 25.4mm in diameter, was cast and homogenized at 1473K for 24h. A 7mm thick slice of this ingot was then compressed to 3mm and annealed at 1073K for 3h. From this slice, a cylindrical specimen 25.4mm in diameter and 3mm thick was cut using EDM and used for the RUS measurements. Additional details of the measurement procedures are described elsewhere[44].",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"Because of their negligible Peierls–Nabarro barriers, the yield strengths of pure fcc metals are relatively insensitive to changes in temperature (at least at low homologous temperatures), as has been discussed elsewhere (e.g.[49–52]), and confirmed by our present results on pure Ni ( Fig. 3 a). On the other hand, temperature-dependent yield strengths have been reported for binary fcc alloys, including Cu–Mn[53,54], Cu–Al[55–57], Cu–Ge[58–60], Cu–Zn[61,62], Cu–Ni[63], Au–Ag[63]and Al–Mg[64], with the yield strength typically increasing at lower temperatures. Both the thermal and athermal portions of the yield strength vs. temperature curves of these binaries often shift to higher values as the solute concentration increases[65,66], suggesting an increase in the number of both short-range dislocation obstacles that can be overcome by thermal activation and longer range obstacles that cannot. Consistent with previous observations in binary alloys (most of which were relatively dilute solid solutions), the compositionally complex equiatomic alloys examined here also exhibit varying degrees of strengthening at lower temperatures, with at least some, for example NiCoCr, NiCoCrMn and FeNiCoCr, exhibiting significant strengthening as the temperature is decreased into the cryogenic range.",['f0015'],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"Yield stress is a combination of the frictional stress (σfr), or the intrinsic lattice resistance to dislocation motion, plus the various incremental strengthening contributions, such as those due to the initial dislocation density (Δσρi), solid solution hardening (Δσss), precipitate hardening (Δσppt) and grain boundary (Hall–Petch) strengthening (Δσgb). A general expression for the yield strength can therefore be written as:(2)σy=σfr+Δσρi+Δσss+Δσppt+Δσgb",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"In the present analysis, two of the terms on the right-hand side (Δσpptand Δσρi) can be eliminated immediately. First, no precipitates are present in our alloys, at least based on their XRD diffraction spectra and BSE images[22], both of which indicate that the alloys are single-phase solid solutions, so Δσpptcan be ignored. Higher magnification transmission electron microscopy (TEM) also failed to reveal any precipitates in the related fcc quinary FeNiCoCrMn[26]. Since all the alloys investigated here are equiatomic fcc subsets of this “parent” alloy, it seems reasonable to assume that the lower order alloys are also free of second phases. Second, TEM of the equiatomic quinary alloy, FeNiCoCrMn, found that representative images from foils of the recrystallized alloy contained practically no dislocations[26]. Since the current alloys were processed similarly and fully recrystallized to produce comparable grain sizes, it is reasonable to assume that their initial dislocation densities are also very low. Assuming that is the case, we ignore the limited contribution of initial dislocation density to yield stress in our analysis.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"Next, we address the third term on the right, Δσss. Mechanistically, as mentioned before, solid solution strengthening has traditionally been considered in relatively dilute solutions where there is a solvent lattice through which the dislocations move and interact with discrete solute atoms. In such cases, the dislocation core comprises almost exclusively like (solvent) atoms that encounter unlike (solute) atoms as it moves through the lattice. At low solute concentrations, the flexibility of the dislocation line allows it to bend around obstacles and take on low-energy configurations. This becomes progressively more difficult as the spacing between obstacles decreases. In the limit of the equiatomic alloys, there is no “solvent” lattice through which the dislocations move and no “solute” atoms that they occasionally encounter, assuming the constituent atoms are truly randomly arranged on the fcc lattice. In this sense, the equiatomic alloys represent a new state of material more akin to a stoichiometric compound with fixed atomic ratios, albeit disordered, than a traditional dilute solid solution. When viewed in this light, it is logical to fold the solid solution hardening term (Δσss) in Eq.(2)into the lattice friction term (σfr), where the latter now represents some “average” resistance offered by all the constituent atoms rather than a single type of solvent atom. This allows us to simplify the expression for the yield strength to:(3)σy(T)=σfr(T)+Δσgb(T)where the temperature dependence of yield strength can be the result of either, or both, of the two terms on the right. In what follows, we first address the second term on the right, Δσgb, which is the contribution of grain boundaries to strength, and then focus mostly on the lattice frictionσfr.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"In the classical Hall–Petch treatment of grain boundary strengthening, a plot of yield strength vs. the inverse square root of grain size is linear. Fig. 4 is such a plot for one of the quaternary equiatomic alloys, FeNiCoCr, at five different temperatures. If the grain boundary strengthening term in Eq.(3)were temperature-dependent, then the Hall–Petch slopes would vary with temperature. However, it is apparent that the slopes in Fig. 4 are all essentially the same. This, coupled with the fact that the alloys in Fig. 3 a all had roughly the same grain size ( Table 1 ), leads us to conclude that grain boundary strengthening does not contribute significantly to the observed temperature dependence of yield strength in the present study.","['f0020', 'f0020', 'f0015']",['t0005']
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"Therefore, the only remaining factor that could produce the observed temperature dependence of yield stress is a temperature-dependent lattice friction stress (σfr). To analyze this, we note that the Peierls–Nabarro stress (henceforth referred to as the Peierls stress,σp), which is commonly used to explain lattice friction, is given by[46]:(4)σp=2G1-νexp-2πωbwhereGis the shear modulus,νis Poisson’s ratio,ωis the dislocation width andbis the magnitude of the Burgers vector. The temperature dependencies ofGandbin this expression can obviously lead to a small temperature dependence of the Peierls stress. However, it has been pointed out that the dislocation widthωcan also be temperature-dependent, and, since it appears in the expression inside the exponential, it may be the dominant factor. The dependence of dislocation width on temperature has been approximated by Dietze[67]as:(5)ωb=ωb0expT3Tmwhere (ω/b)0indicates values at 0K,Tis the test temperature andTmis the melting temperature. Ignoring the change ofbwith temperature, and using a simple Taylor expansion, we can rewrite Eq.(5)as:(6)ω≈ω01+T3Tmwhereω0is the dislocation width at 0K. This indicates a linear relationship between dislocation width and absolute temperature provided the temperature is low compared to the melting temperature, a relationship used previously by Petch[68]. Therefore, to a first approximation:(7)ω=ω0(1+αT)whereαis a small positive constant. Combining Eqs.(7) and (4), the temperature dependence of the Peierls stress becomes:(8)σp=2G1-νexp-2πω0b∗exp-2πω0bαT",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"From the above expression, the Peierls stress at 0K can be obtained as:(9)σp(0)=2G1-νexp-2πω0b",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"This suggests that if the temperature dependence of yield stress is the same as that of the Peierls stress, the yield stress will decay with temperature in an exponential way.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"To check the validity of these concepts, the yield stress data are re-plotted in Fig. 5 , along with data obtained previously for the equiatomic quinary alloy FeNiCoCrMn of comparable grain size[26]. It was found that the data are well described by curve fits (dashed lines) shown in Fig. 5 of the form:(10)σy(T)=σaexp-TC+σbwhereσa,Candσbare fitting constants. When written this way, the first term on the right represents the thermal or temperature-dependent part of the yield strength and the second term is the temperature-independent or athermal part.

3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"Values of the parametersσa,Candσbdetermined from least squares fits of the experimental data are listed in Table 2 . Since it has been shown[69,70]that Eq.(4)is a reasonable approximation of the Peierls stress over the range ∼0.4<ω/b<∼2.1 (i.e. 0.5b<ω<2b), the table also includes values of the Peierls stress at 0K,σp(0), calculated from Eq.(9), assumingω0=0.5b,b, 1.5band 2b, which can be compared with the values ofσafound from the curve fits. The shear moduli and Poisson’s ratios used in the calculations were measured by ultrasonic techniques and are given in Table 3 . For the equiatomic alloys, the calculated Peierls stress at 0K (σp(0)) has the best match with the fittedσavalues whenω0=b. For pure Ni, on the other hand, the match is better whenω0=1.5b. We are not aware of any published data for the dislocation widths in pure Ni, but a value of 1.5bhas been reported for pure Cu[60,71], and this agrees well with the value derived here for Ni. The reasonable match between the calculated and fitted values lends credence to the analysis and suggests that the dislocations in the equiatomic alloys are narrower than in pure fcc metals. Additionally, the analysis suggests that the temperature dependence of the yield strength of the equiatomic alloys may be due to thermally induced changes in dislocation width that, in turn, produce a temperature dependence of the Peierls stress.",[],"['t0010', 't0015']"
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"To further check the validity of this analysis, values forαin Eq.(8)were calculated from the fittedCvalues by means of Eq.(12), where it was assumed thatω0=bfor the equiatomic alloys and 1.5bfor pure Ni. These are listed in Table 2 , along with values for the product ofαandTm. For most of the equiatomic alloys and pure Ni, the product ofαandTmlies in the neighborhood of 1 (∼0.8-1.5), implying thatα≈1/Tm.

3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"It is generally believed that Peierls barriers are high in bcc metals and relatively low in fcc metals and that a major factor contributing to this difference is the relative widths of the dislocations. The present analysis suggests that the dislocations in equiatomic fcc alloys may be narrower than those in pure fcc metals, which could lead to a stronger Peierls barrier and temperature dependence of strength. However, the temperature dependence of the equiatomic alloys, while stronger than that of pure fcc metals, is not as strong as that of bcc metals. Specifically, from room temperature to liquid nitrogen temperature, the yield stress of the equiatomic fcc alloys increases by a factor of ∼1.3–2.0 in comparison to a factor of ∼3.5 for bcc metals such as iron[73]and tantalum[74]. Thus, the Peierls barrier height of the fcc equiatomic alloys is likely intermediate to that of pure fcc and bcc metals.",[],[]
3.1,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on yield strength,"It should be noted that all of these arguments are premised on the notion that the primary source of the temperature dependence of the yield strength is the temperature-dependent height of the Peierls barrier. Other temperature dependences could accrue from the thermally activated processes that control dislocation mobility during glide, but these have not been explicitly addressed here. Detailed knowledge of the specific mechanisms responsible for these thermally activated processes would be needed to model them accurately in future investigations.",[],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on strain hardening,"Since flow stress depends on the yield stress and work hardening (Eq.(1)), either one or both could cause the observed temperature dependence of flow stress in the equiatomic alloys. As discussed above, yield stress does indeed depend on temperature, and its origin can be ascribed to a temperature-induced change in the dislocation width and friction stress. To investigate the temperature dependence of strain hardening, we first note that the engineering stress–strain curves of some of the equiatomic alloys in Fig. 2 appear to be parallel to each other at different temperatures. If this is generally true, it implies that the strain-hardening component of the flow stress (Δσρ) is essentially temperature-independent, leaving the temperature dependence of the yield stress (σy) as the primary contributor. To determine whether this is in fact the case, the engineering stress–strain curves in Fig. 2 were converted to true stress–strain curves and the 0.2% yield stress was subtracted from each value of stress to give the portion of the flow stress associated with strain hardening, Δσρ=σflow−Δσy. The results are shown in Fig. 6 . Clearly, the curves do not fully converge, indicating that the strain hardening (Δσρ) does indeed depend on temperature to some extent.","['f0010', 'f0010', 'f0030']",[]

Among the terms on the right-hand side of Eq.(15), the shear modulusGis certainly temperature-dependent. To investigate if this is the primary origin of the temperature dependence of the strain hardening, the isotropic shear modulus of FeNiCoCr was measured at 293, 473 and 673K using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy. The shear moduli of pure Ni at these temperatures were obtained from Ref.[75], and the modulus of FeNi was calculated from known single crystal elastic constantsC11,C12andC44[75]using the formula given by Hashin and Shtrikman[76].

These normalized curves generally converge up to certain strains, namely, ∼13% for the two alloys and ∼5% for pure Ni. If this trend holds true in the remaining alloys, it suggests that, at low strains, the temperature dependence of strain hardening in Eq.(14)is indeed mainly due to the temperature dependence of shear modulus and that dislocation multiplication, interaction and accumulation occur in a temperature-independent manner during the early stages of plastic deformation. However, follow-on studies are needed to characterize the temperature dependence of the moduli of these materials before the general validity of the above conclusion for this class of alloys can be confirmed.","['f0030', 'f0035']",['t0020']
3.2,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on strain hardening,"In addition to displaying higher strengths, many of the equiatomic alloys are significantly more ductile than pure Ni, and their ductilities generally increase with decreasing temperature, as shown in Fig. 3 . Similar trends were reported in earlier papers on high and medium entropy alloys[24,26], where the high ductilities were ascribed to their high work hardening capability, which postpones the onset of necking instability according to Considere’s criterion. To evaluate its role in the present study, the extent of work hardening, defined here as the difference between the UTS and the yield strength, is plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 8 for the equiatomic alloys and pure Ni. To varying degrees, the work hardening capability of all the materials increases with decreasing temperature, similar to what was observed before in the equiatomic quinary alloy FeNiCoCrMn[24,26], as well as in other fcc alloys[77–82]. It appears therefore that this may be the reason for the increasing ductility with decreasing temperature.","['f0015', 'f0040']",[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on strain hardening,"One of the mechanisms for the much higher work hardening capability at cryogenic temperatures in the FeNiCoCrMn alloy is deformation-induced nano-twinning[26], which can provide strengthening because of the additional internal twin boundaries generated, the so-called “dynamic Hall–Petch” effect. Deformation twinning occurs in fcc metals and alloys with low stacking fault energy (γSFE), such as 70:30 brass[83], but not in fcc metals with medium or high stacking fault energy, such as Al[84]. The critical stacking fault energy below which twinning occurs in fcc materials has been reported to be ∼45mJm−2. At higher stacking fault energies (>45mJm−2), deformation is controlled by dislocation glide whereas at very low stacking fault energies (<18mJm−2), martensitic transformation is favored over deformation twinning[85,86]. At low temperatures, even materials withγSFE>45mJm−2are found to be mechanically twinned, for example, Cu[87], whoseγSFEis ∼80mJm−2[46]. Even in pure Ni (γSFE∼150mJm−2)[46], deformation twinning occurs under shock loading conditions[88]. Previous studies have shown that the addition of Fe, Co, Cr and Mn to pure Ni reduces the stacking fault energy, with Cr having the largest effect and Fe the smallest[89,90]. TheγSFEof FeNiCoCr and FeNiCoCrMn has been estimated to be ∼30mJm−2and 20–25mJm−2, respectively[91], suggesting a tendency to twin during deformation. Nevertheless, additional work is needed to confirm whether, and to what extent, twinning contributes to work hardening in the present set of alloys. Martensitic transformation appears not to be a contributing factor since post-fracture XRD performed on specimens tested at 77K revealed no new phases.",[],[]
3.2,Results and discussion.Effects of temperature on strain hardening,"The representative fracture surfaces in Fig. 9 show that there is significantly less macroscopic necking in the equiatomic alloy, FeNi, than in pure Ni, consistent with its higher tensile ductility and work hardening capability that postpones the onset of necking instability according to Considere’s criterion. Microscopically, however, both exhibit ductile dimples on their fracture surfaces. A similar lack of necking was observed in the other equiatomic alloys that exhibited high ductilities. Microscopically, all the fcc alloys examined here exhibited ductile dimples on their fracture surfaces.",['f0045'],[]
4,Summary and conclusions,"Several binary, ternary and quaternary alloys with equiatomic compositions were arc-melted, cast, cold rolled and recrystallized to produce equiaxed grains of comparable size. All the alloys are subsets of a quinary fcc high-entropy alloy that was previously investigated (FeNiCoCrMn) and consisted of single-phase solid solutions with the fcc structure. For comparison, unalloyed fcc Ni was also investigated. The effects of temperature on tensile properties were quantified over the temperature range of 77–673K, yielding the following observations:(1)The flow stress of the equiatomic alloys is temperature-dependent to varying degrees depending on the alloy. The yield and ultimate strengths of NiCoCr, NiCoCrMn and FeNiCoCr increase strongly with decreasing temperature whereas those of NiCo and Ni exhibit very weak temperature dependencies.(2)Alloying affects both the thermal and athermal portions of the yield stress vs. temperature curves.(3)The stronger alloys are not necessarily the ones with the most elements. The nature of the constituent elements is also important, with the Cr-containing alloys in general being the strongest.(4)The Hall–Petch slopes of the FeNiCoCr alloy are essentially independent of test temperature. This implies that grain-boundary strengthening is unlikely to be a major contributor to the observed temperature dependence of the yield strength.(5)An analysis suggests that the temperature dependence of the yield strength in the alloys may be determined by Peierls-barrier-dominated lattice friction, with the height of the Peierls barrier controlled by thermal influences on the width of the dislocation. By fitting the experimental yield stress vs. temperature curves to the Peierls–Nabarro equation, the barriers in the equiatomic fcc alloys appear to be stronger than those in pure fcc metals but weaker than those in pure bcc metals.(6)The UTS and uniform elongation to fracture of all the equiatomic alloys increase with decreasing temperature, with the largest increase occurring between 77 and 293K. It is possible that deformation twinning similar to that observed in the FeNiCoCrMn high-entropy alloy[26]contributes to the enhanced ductility at cryogenic temperatures in some of the alloys. Additional work is needed to verify this.(7)During the initial stages of plastic deformation (5–13% strain, depending on material), the temperature dependence of strain hardening is due almost entirely to the temperature dependence of the shear modulus. This indicates the athermal nature of dislocation multiplication, accumulation and interaction during the early stages of deformation.",[],[]
4,Summary and conclusions,"The flow stress of the equiatomic alloys is temperature-dependent to varying degrees depending on the alloy. The yield and ultimate strengths of NiCoCr, NiCoCrMn and FeNiCoCr increase strongly with decreasing temperature whereas those of NiCo and Ni exhibit very weak temperature dependencies.",[],[]
