0,Abstract,"The influence of annealing on the constitutive stress-strain response of nanocrystalline (nc) CoCrFeMnNi high-entropy alloy (HEA) was investigated through a series of nanoindentation experiments using five different three-sided pyramidal indenters. The nc HEA, produced by high-pressure torsion (HPT), was subjected to annealing at 450 °C for 1 and 10 h. Microstructural analysis using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that three different nano-scale precipitates (NiMn-, FeCo-, and Co-rich phases) form in the primary single-phase matrix of nc HEA after annealing. The strain-dependent plastic flow response of nc HEA pre- and post-annealing was estimated using the indentation strain and constraint factor, revealing a significant strain softening in nc HEA, which becomes pronounced after annealing. TEM analysis of the deformed material underneath the indenter suggests that the plastic deformation aids in the dissolution of the annealing-induced intermetallic precipitates, which could be the mechanism for the pronounced softening. The dissolution mechanism was rationalized by the destabilization of precipitates during plastic deformation due to the increase in interface energy.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"High-entropy alloys (HEAs), a new class of alloys defined for practical purposes as multicomponent alloys containing five or more elements in (near-)equal atomic percent, exhibit excellent mechanical properties over a wide range of temperatures (from elevated to cryogenic temperatures)[1–5]. Recently, it has been reported that those properties of HEAs can be further enhanced in a substantial manner through significant grain refinement, which can be easily achieved by severe plastic deformation (SPD) processing methods such as equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP)[6]and high-pressure torsion (HPT)[7]. It is possible to obtain nanocrystalline (nc) structure (average grain size,d< 100 nm[8–12]) in HEAs by subjecting them to HPT, which paves the way for exploiting synergy between HEA and nc alloys[13–16].",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Recently, the issue of phase stability in HEAs during thermal treatments has been examined closely. It was observed that secondary phases can form in the HEA matrix, when they are annealed at the temperatures below ∼800 °C[14,17–20]. Since grain boundaries (GBs), especially non-equilibrium GBs in HPT-processed materials, can serve as energetically favorable nucleation sites for the formation of new phases, the annealing-induced formation of new phases is expected to be accelerated in nc HEAs due to the large fraction of GBs in them. Indeed, Schuh et al.[14]reported that the decomposition of the primary matrix phase occurs in nc CoCrFeMnNi HEA in an accelerated manner (i.e., in 5 min at 450 °C). They also observed a significant hardness increase and concomitant ductility loss in the nc HEA after annealing, which suggests that further investigation of the annealing effects may be required for elevated temperature applications of nc HEAs. Nevertheless, the annealing effect on the constitutive stress-strain behavior in the plastic regime (i.e., strain hardening or softening), which is crucial from the potential applications point of view, has not yet been studied systematically due to the difficulties in conventional mechanical testing. Vickers hardness tests provide only hardness corresponding to a specific single indentation strain, and tensile tests using micro-sized samples cannot represent the properties of only nc HEA since there is a marked gradient of microstructure in HPT-processed disk samples and only the edge regions of the disks (that can hardly cover the whole gauge part of tensile specimen) show nc structures.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"This difficulty may be overcome by performing nanoindentation tests that can estimate various mechanical properties by analyzing load-displacement (P-h) curve recorded during the experiment[21–24]. In addition to being a simple and easy procedure, nanoindentation offers many advantages; the important one being that it requires only small volumes of test material. Thus, the tests have been extensively performed to explore mechanical properties of local microstructures[25,26]. Recently, Maier-Kiener et al.[27]performed such experiments on nc CoCrFeMnNi HEA annealed at various temperatures and investigated the influence of annealing on hardness and elastic modulus, from which the usefulness of the nanoindentation technique in the mechanical analysis of nc HEAs was established[27]. Additionally, such tests also allow for the exploration of the strain-dependent plastic flow behavior. There are two possible ways for achieving this goal. The first one is by using a spherical tip. Since this tip does not have a geometrical self-similarity, stressσand strainεunderneath the indenter can increase with the applied load. Although it has a strong merit that elastic deformation and yield behavior can be obtained during indentation, plastic deformation at large strains cannot be achieved for the following two practical issues. (1) The depth to which spherical shape can be maintained is limited due to the limitation of the tip manufacturing process. (2) The widely used Hertz theory for the analysis of spherical indentation is developed on the assumption that the tip geometry is a “paraboloid of revolution” that can be considered as a “sphere” and hence is applicable only for shallow depths of penetration. Another way ofσ-εestimation is using a series of sharp (typically, three-sided pyramidal) indenters having different indenter angles. Generally, sharper indenters induce larger elasto-plastic strains in the material[23,28–30], and indentations made with different angles lead to different levels of plastic strain, thereby allowing a systematic evaluation of the effects of the imposed strain.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Accordingly, here we explored the influence of the annealing on the strain-dependent plastic flow, and thus on the constitutive behavior of HPT-processed nc CoCrFeMnNi through a series of nanoindentation experiments using five different three-sided pyramidal indenters having different values for the centerline-to-face angle,ψ. In addition, the tests under the identical conditions were also carried out on the coarse-grained (cg) HEA (i.e., as-cast HEA) for comparison purposes. The results revealed that the nature of plastic flow in nc CoCrFeMnNi HEA is significantly affected by the annealing treatment.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"The equiatomic CoCrFeMnNi HEA examined in this work was prepared by arc-melting a mixture of pure metals (purity >99 wt.%) in a Ti-gettered high-purity Ar atmosphere. The as-cast alloy was cut and electrical-discharge machined into 10 mm diameter, 0.8 mm thick disks. They were subjected to HPT at room temperature with a pressure of 6.0 GPa at 1 rpm for a total of 2 turns.Fig. 1shows the microstructures of the as-cast and HPT-processed HEA samples. It is evident that HPT induces a substantial reduction in average grain sizedfrom ∼40 μm to ∼40 nm, which confirms earlier observations that HPT process can achieve significant grain refinement in the CoCrFeMnNi HEA[13–15]. Subsequent to HPT, some samples were subjected to annealing at 450 °C (at which hardness was found to be the maximum in the previous isochronal annealing study[14]) for 1 and 10 h (hereafter, designated HPT+1A and HPT+10A samples, respectively). For comparison purposes, the as-cast sample was also examined, and thus there are four different samples that were tested here; as-cast, HPT, HPT + 1A, and HPT + 10A samples. The surfaces of the specimens were mechanically polished with fine SiC papers (grit number up to 2000) and subsequently with 0.05 μm colloidal silica. Then, surfaces were vibration-polished for 24 h with 0.02 μm colloidal silica using VibroMet 2 (Buehler, Lake Bluff, IL) to remove any possible surface damage induced during prior polishing.",['fig1'],[]
2,Experimental,"Nanoindentation experiments were performed at the edge regions (within 0.3 mm from the edge) of the HPT disks using a Nanoindenter-XP (formerly MTS; now Keysight, Santa Rosa, CA) with five different three-sided pyramidal indenters having a centerline-to-face angleψof 35.3° (cube-corner indenter), 50°, 65.3° (Berkovich indenter), 75°, and 85°. The samples were loaded to a maximum load,Pmax, of 100 mN under constant strain rate, (dP/dt)/P(wherePis indentation load), of 0.05 /s. More than 20 tests were performed for each condition. The hardness impressions were imaged using atomic force microscopy (AFM; XE-100, Park Systems, Suwon, Korea).",[],[]
2,Experimental,"Annealing-induced microstructural changes were examined using transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Talos F200×, FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR). To prepare cross-sectional TEM samples, focused ion beam (FIB) milling was performed with a Nova 200 NanoLab (FEI Co., Hillsboro, OR). During TEM analysis, element mapping was performed using energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS).",[],[]
3.1,Results.Nanoindentation hardness variation,"RepresentativeP–hcurves of the HPT, HPT + 1A, and HPT + 10A samples recorded during nanoindentations with five indenters with differentψare displayed inFig. 2a. Since the recorded displacement range for the as-cast sample differs significantly from those processed by HPT, itsP-hplots are displayed separately in the inset ofFig. 2a. It is clear that the displacement at the peak load,hmax, decreases with increasingψfor all four samples. Importantly,hmaxfor a givenψdecreases in the sequence of as-cast, HPT, HPT + 1A, and HPT + 10A.","['fig2', 'fig2']",[]
3.1,Results.Nanoindentation hardness variation,"The ratio of the residual displacement after unloading,hf, tohmaxis a useful indicator of the relative portion of the plastic deformation in the total elasto-plastic deformation that occurs during indentation.Fig. 2b summarizes the variations inhf/hmaxwithψfor all samples. For a givenψ, thehf/hmaxvalues obtained from three HPT-processed samples are much lower than for the as-cast sample, implying that plasticity in the former is less pronounced than in the latter. Importantly, the value ofhf/hmaxincreases with decreasingψ, indicating that indeed a higher level of plasticity is produced with a sharper indenter. Forψ= 35.3° (the sharpest tip), all four samples exhibit highhf/hmaxvalues (> ∼0.9), indicating that the portion of plasticity is much higher than that of elasticity. Forψ= 85° (the least sharp tip), a clear difference can be found between the as-cast and other samples; while the as-cast sample continues to show relatively high values ofhf/hmax(∼0.74), the three HPT-processed samples show very lowhf/hmaxvalues around 0.2. These results suggest that, forψ= 85°, the portion of elasticity is much higher than that of plasticity in HPT-processed samples whereas plasticity still prevails over elasticity in the as-cast sample.",['fig2'],[]
3.1,Results.Nanoindentation hardness variation,"The most popular procedure for estimating the hardness by only nanoindentationP-hcurve analysis is the Oliver-Pharr (O-P) method[21]. Nevertheless, here we did not adopt the O-P method. This is mainly because the correlation constantβin the O-P method (which relates stiffnessSto contact areaAand thus must be known for determining the area function and hence the hardness) is known only for the commonly used Berkovich indenter (as a constant of 1.034[21]), but not for other indenters although some effort has been made[31].",[],[]
3.1,Results.Nanoindentation hardness variation,"To overcome this difficulty and directly obtain the hardnessHbyH=Pmax/A, we measured the impression areasAfrom a large number of AFM images.Fig. 3displays representative AFM micrographs of the indents. In the HPT, HPT + 1A, HPT + 10A samples, significant material pile-ups around the indents are seen forψ≤ 50°, and they become more pronounced forψ= 35.3°, which is similar to previous reports for other metals and alloys[29,31]. The large pile-up is more obvious inFig. 4, which shows the AFM images and line scan data across the indents. Such pile-up can induce an overestimation of the calculatedHin the O-P method[29,31], and theψ-dependent pile-up complicates the analysis of the relation betweenHandψ. Such pile-up issue is fully circumvented in the present study sinceHwas obtained directly from the measuredA.","['fig3', 'fig4']",[]
3.1,Results.Nanoindentation hardness variation,"Fig. 5summarizes the variations inHas a function ofψfor all four samples. Two features are noteworthy. First, for a givenψ, theHvalue is largely enhanced by the HPT process and further increases upon annealing. Second, for all samples,Hvaries with reducingψ(i.e., increasing indentation strain), but the trend is different between as-cast and three HPT-processed samples. In the as-cast sample,Hincreases linearly with decreasingψ. In HPT-processed samples, in contrast,His a maximum at 65.3° and decreases at lower and higher angles. This variation inHwithψis related to the constitutive behavior of each material, which is discussed later.",['fig5'],[]
3.2,Results.Microstructural changes,"To observe the annealing-induced microstructural change, TEM analyses were performed on the HPT and HPT + 10A samples.Fig. 6a shows scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) image of the HPT sample, which exhibits nc structure with an average grain sizedof ∼40 nm. To illustrate the chemical composition, EDS elemental mapping was performed for an identical area where the STEM image ofFig. 6a was taken. The EDS maps of the HPT-processed sample (Fig. 6b–g) indicate a homogeneous distributions of constituent elements without any clear segregation or clustering. This result is consistent with previous atom probe tomography study[14]reporting that the HPT-processed CoCrFeMnNi HEA is a single-phase solid solution. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that strengthening by HPT inFig. 5is mainly due to the grain refinement.","['fig6', 'fig6', 'fig6', 'fig5']",[]
3.2,Results.Microstructural changes,"Fig. 7shows a representative STEM image of HPT + 10A sample and the corresponding EDS element maps for the same area. It is seen inFig. 7a that HEA + 10A sample has a slightly largerdthan HEA sample but nevertheless it exhibits nc structure withdof ∼60 nm. The most noticeable microstructural evolution induced by annealing is the nano-scale chemical decomposition (Fig. 7b–g), that is, the solid solution in the nc HEA becomes unstable and decomposes into multiple phases after 10 h annealing. As shown in the EDS maps (especiallyFig. 7g), three new phases were observed; i.e., a phase rich in Ni and Mn, a phase only with Cr, and a phase rich in Fe and Co (hereafter, to be referred to as NiMn, Cr, and FeCo phases, respectively).Table 1summarizes the average chemical compositions that were obtained from more than three EDS point spectra for each phase. These three different phases were also reported for the coarse-grained (cg) CoCrFeMnNi HEA after long-term annealing at 500 °C for 500 days[18]. The chemical compositions of the phases reported in that study are similar to those inTable 1, and the crystal structures of the new phases were identified as body-centered cubic (bcc) solid solution for the Cr particles, L10structure for the NiMn phases, and B2 structure for the FeCo phases. Although the particles inFig. 7g seem to be identical to those in the annealed cg HEA[18], there are two major differences. First, in the annealed cg HEA, the new phases preferentially precipitate along the grain boundaries (GBs) that can be energetically preferred nucleation sites for the phases[32,33]. In annealed nc HEA of the present study, the new phases have almost the same size as the matrix grain and are random in terms of the location where they precipitated as seen inFig. 7g. This difference is somewhat expected given the large portion of GBs in nc HEA. Second, for the precipitation of the new phases, the annealing of cg HEA[18]took much longer time (500 days) than for the nc HEA in this study. This difference is also rationalized by the large portion of GBs that can enhance the diffusion kinetics. In consideration of these possible reasons for the difference, we conclude that the Cr, NiMn, and FeCo phases observed in this study are the same as those observed previously (i.e., bcc phase, L10phase, and B2 phase, respectively).","['fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7', 'fig7']","['tbl1', 'tbl1']"
3.2,Results.Microstructural changes,"Since the presence of these phases are the main difference in the “observed” microstructure between HPT and HPT+10A samples, one may expect that they play a critical role in the annealing-induced hardening in nc HEA, as suggested earlier by Schuh et al.[14]. As shown inFig. 7g, the sizes of the new phases are similar to (or even larger than)dof the matrix phase. Thus, the strengthening mechanism by these new phases is comparable to that seen in composites rather than particle (precipitation) hardening; that is, such phases having intermetallic character (especially, NiMn and FeCo phases) would be much harder than the matrix phase and thus increase the global strength of the nc HEA[14].",['fig7'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Constitutive behavior,"As mentioned earlier, plastic flow behavior of the indented samples can be estimated by converting theHvs.ψdata inFig. 5into stress vs. strain plots[23,24,29]. For this, the following two aspects need recognition. First, the characteristic (or indentation) strainεcharunderneath a sharp indenter is independent ofhdue to its geometrical self-similarity. Second,εcharof a conical indenter having a half-cone angleθis determined as[24,34].(1)εchar=0.2⋅tan(π−θ)=0.2⋅cotθ",['fig5'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Constitutive behavior,"For the case that a cone withθand a three-sided pyramid withψproduce the same area-to-depth ratio, cotθof Eq.(1)can be obtained as:(2)cotθ=(33π⋅tanψ)−1which leads toεcharforψ= 85, 75, 65.3, 50, and 35.3° as 0.014, 0.042, 0.072, 0.13, and 0.22, respectively.",['fd1'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Constitutive behavior,"Next, the measuredHvalues can be converted into corresponding flow stresses,σf, by the well-known empirical relationship originally suggested by Tabor[35], i.e.,H=Cθ⋅σf, whereCθis the constraint factor. AlthoughCθis often considered as 2.7 or 3 for the fully plastic regime of indentation, it would be a strong function ofψin the elasto-plastic regime[34]. In this regime, Johnson[34]estimatedCθas(3)Cθ=Hσf=23[2+ln(13E⋅cotθσy)]whereEis elastic modulus andσyis yield strength. Note that this equation is based on Johnson’s expanding cavity model in which the volume conservation of material (i.e., Poisson’s ratio is 0.5) is assumed and flow is assumed to be pressure-insensitive[34]. Eq.(3)shows thatCθcan be determined not only by cotθ(of Eq.(2)) but also by material properties such asEandσy. If elastic properties do not vary significantly during the HPT process and subsequent annealing, the value ofEof the cg (as-cast) HEA (∼200 GPa[36,37]) can be adopted in Eq.(3)for all nc HEA (HPT, HPT + 1A, and HPT + 10A) samples. However, information about the variation inσyduring HPT process and subsequent annealing is still required for estimating theCθof HPT, HPT + 1A, and HPT + 10A samples by Eq.(3). While theσyfor cg (as-cast) and nc (HPT) samples has been well documented (∼0.2 GPa[38]and ∼1.4 GPa[14,19], respectively), theσyfor annealed nc samples are unknown. Therefore, we attempted to estimateσyof all samples by using the nanoindentation data. Sinceψ= 85° can apply substantially lowhf/hmax(especially for nc samples) andεchar(∼0.014), it is reasonable to assume that the correspondingσfis close toσy. Thus, by substitutingHandθvalues forψ= 85° into Eq.(3), the middle term of it becomesH/σy, which then can be written as:(4)Hσy=232+ln13E⋅cotθσyforψ=85°","['fd3', 'fd2', 'fd3', 'fd3', 'fd3']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Constitutive behavior,"Here, the elastic properties of all samples in the right-hand term are those of the as-cast sample (as mentioned above), andHof each sample in the left-hand term can be directly obtained from nanoindentation tests withψ= 85°. To determine theσyvalues for each specimen by solving Eq.(4), an arbitrary value ofσywas put into both the left- and right-hand term. Then, it was varied until the value of the left- and right-hand terms became the same, at which the correspondingσywas determined as theσyof each sample.Fig. 8shows this procedure and the results obtained; i.e.,σyfor as-cast, HPT, HPT + 1A, and HPT + 10A were determined as ∼0.4, ∼1.6, ∼2.3, and ∼3.3 GPa, respectively. The values ofσyfor as-cast and HPT samples estimated from Eq.(4)are in a good agreement with the literature data[14,19,38](in consideration of indentation size effect, ISE[39], that can explain the small discrepancy), which implies that the estimatedσyof HPT + 1A and HPT + 10A samples may also be reasonable.","['fd4', 'fig8', 'fd4']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Constitutive behavior,"With the estimatedσy, values ofCθfor each condition can be determined by using Eq.(3), and are summarized inTable 2. Based on the assumption that the elastic-plastic regime ends and a fully plastic regime begins atCθ= 3[34], if the calculatedCθis higher than 3, we adoptedCθ= 3 instead of the calculated value inTable 2. With these values ofCθ, nowHcan be converted intoσf. The variations inσfwithεcharfor all samples are plotted inFig. 9, where the tensile test data for the as-cast HEA obtained by Wu et al.[38]is also shown for comparison purposes. In the case of the as-cast sample, although there is a slight difference in stress (possibly due to the ISE[39]that is not considered in the procedure we have used here), the estimated stress-strain relation and its hardening behavior are in reasonably good agreement with the results from tensile testing. By extension, the estimated stress-strain relations of the three nc HEAs (HPT, HPT + 1A, and HPT + 10A) inFig. 9can be considered representative.","['fd3', 'fig9', 'fig9']","['tbl2', 'tbl2']"
4.2,Discussion.Strain softening and its possible mechanisms,"InFig. 9, all nc HEA samples (HPT, HPT + 1A, and HPT + 10A) exhibit strain softening behavior, which is opposite to the work hardening of the cg (as-cast) sample. Strain softening phenomena have been frequently observed in tensile and compressive tests of nc and ultrafine-grained (ufg) metals and alloys[40–43]. Recently, this softening behavior was also reported for HPT-processed nc CoCuFeNi HEA[16]. For conventional nc metals, a variety of possible mechanisms such as extensive dynamic recovery[44,45], dynamic recrystallization[46–48], and the existence of residual internal stress in GBs[49]have been proposed to explain this softening behavior, although there remains controversy over the mechanism. In the case of nc HEA, which mechanism is the most predominant for the strain softening is unclear as yet and requires further analysis in the future, but it is anticipated that similar mechanisms to those for conventional nc metals may still be valid.",['fig9'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Strain softening and its possible mechanisms,"The most interesting feature related with strain softening inFig. 9is that the softening behavior becomes more pronounced as the annealing time increases, i.e., the HPT + 10A sample exhibits the largest amount of softening whereas the HPT sample shows the smallest one. This indicates that in comparison of only HPT-processed sample (which may be governed by proposed softening mechanisms of other nc metals and alloys[44–49]), an additional mechanism may be at work in the strain softening of annealed HPT samples. To gain insights into the possible additional mechanism of annealed HPT samples, the change in microstructure of annealed HPT sample with the appliedεcharwas investigated.Fig. 10a and b shows the microstructures of HPT + 10A sample underneath the indentation produced with Berkovich (ψ= 65.3°) and cube-corner tip (ψ= 35.3°), respectively. The subsurface regions also exhibit the annealing-induced precipitates (Cr, NiMn, and FeCo) as observed in the undeformed region ofFig. 7g. The volume fraction of each phase is listed inTable 3. The fraction of the precipitates was reduced by almost one-half asεcharincreases from 0.08 (Berkovich) to 0.22 (cube-corner), which implies that the second phases were dissolved due to the extensive plastic deformation. This led us to the conclusion that more pronounced strain softening behavior in annealed nc HEA sample may be attributed to the deformation-assisted dissolution of the precipitates. It is noteworthy that some extent of indenter tip bluntness is observed for the cube-corner indentations (Fig. 10b). This tip bluntness is inevitable in a sharp indenter, since imperfections are created during indenter production and, more importantly, the indenter is progressively worn out as it is used. Although the tip bluntness may affect the measured results (especially for a shallow-depth indentation)[50], such influence was not significant here due to the large indentation depth (hmax∼2000 nm for cube-corner indenter, seeFig. 2a) and thus very small portion of the bluntness-affected region within the total plastic zone underneath the indenter.","['fig9', 'fig10', 'fig7', 'fig10', 'fig2']",['tbl3']
4.2,Discussion.Strain softening and its possible mechanisms,"The deformation-induced dissolution of a second phase has been reported in many metallic systems and was frequently explained by recourse to the thermodynamics of the metastable phases[51–58]according to which, plastic deformation could lead to the destabilization of second phases. To evaluate the thermodynamic stability of the intermetallic NiMn and FeCo phases in the annealed HEA at room temperature, the “stress-independent” activation energy for the dissolution,ΔGdiss,0(=ΔGHEA−ΔGint), was calculated. The Gibbs free energy for the formation of HEA,ΔGHEA, is given as(5)ΔGHEA=ΔHHEA−TΔSHEAwhereΔHandΔSare the enthalpy and entropy of mixing, respectively, andTis the absolute temperature. For the HEA examined in this study, the values ofΔHHEAandΔSHEAare ∼ -4.8 kJ/mol and ∼13.4 J/mol K, respectively[1]. Then, atT= 298 K, Eq.(5)yieldsΔGHEAas −8.8 kJ/mol. Similarly, the value of the Gibbs free energy for the formation of intermetallic phase,ΔGint, can be calculated. Since its mixing entropyΔSintcan be assumed as 0 for ordered intermetallics,ΔGintbecomes the same as the mixing enthalpyΔHint[59]. The values ofΔHintfor NiMn and FeCo intermetallics are reported as −12.2[59,60]and −10.1 kJ/mol[61], respectively, which are adopted asΔGintin this study. With these values,ΔGdiss,0values for NiMn phase and FeCo phase are determined as ∼3.4 and ∼1.3 kJ/mol, respectively, which are within the range reported for the activation barrier for solid state transformation (0.3–3 kJ/mol[58,62]) including martensitic transformation that also can be induced by plastic deformation. Furthermore, Languillaume et al.[51]calculated the value ofΔGdiss,0for cementite in pearlitic steel as ∼15 kJ/mol, and reported that (at least partial) dissolution of cementite occurred during cold wire drawing. All these observations suggest that the dissolution of the secondary intermetallic phases in the HEA can occur at room temperature, and it may become easier during plastic deformation.",['fd5'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Strain softening and its possible mechanisms,"It was often suggested that the deformation-assisted destabilization of intermetallic particles is attributed to the increasing matrix-particle interface energy due to the dislocation accumulation during plastic deformation[51–53,56,63]. It is apparent from Eq.(1)andFig. 2b that a sharper indenter imposes a higher level of plastic deformation, and thus induces higher interface energy. Especially, the contribution of interface energy to the particle dissolution is more pronounced for a harder phase, since the density of geometrically necessary dislocations (GNDs) near the interface between soft matrix and hard phase is dependent on strain gradients across the interface[64–66]. This scenario is consistent with the experimental results that the dissolutions of NiMn and FeCo phases are more pronounced than that of Cr phase (seeFig. 10andTable 3). For nc metals, however, the capacity of dislocation accumulation is not expected to be sufficiently high due to their extremely small grain size[10,11,67]. Therefore, in this study, deformation-assisted dissolution cannot be exclusively explained only by dislocations accumulation at the matrix/particle interfaces.","['fd1', 'fig2', 'fig10']",['tbl3']
4.2,Discussion.Strain softening and its possible mechanisms,"Another contribution to the dissolution can be envisaged by considering the friction at the matrix-particle interface. Ivanisenko et al.[54]proposed that the flow of a soft matrix around harder particles can impose high strain energy on the interface due to the friction at the interface. In this regard, the friction at the interface during nanoindentation may play a role for increasing interface energy, and it will be enhanced for a sharper indentation.",[],[]
4.2,Discussion.Strain softening and its possible mechanisms,"In addition, in order for the thermodynamic non-equilibrium of secondary phases to be a driving force for their dissolution, a substantial atomic diffusion should occur during the deformation. In the present case, the high fraction of GBs in annealed nc HEA can become channels for migration of atoms. Note that the large pressure gradient underneath the indenter can significantly increase the diffusivity[68,69]. In this respect, the larger pressure gradient underneath a sharper indenter may further enhance the diffusivity, resulting in the promotion of the second phase dissolution. However, additional experiments and simulations are required to provide a full picture of the deformation-assisted particle dissolution mechanism in annealed nc HEAs.",[],[]
5,Conclusion,"In the present study, annealing effects on the stress-strain behavior of HPT-processed CoCrFeMnNi HEAs were systematically investigated through nanoindentation experiments with five different three-sided pyramidal indenters. Nanohardness measurements show that the hardness of nc HEA increases further upon annealing at 450 °C. The annealing-induced hardening is mainly due to the formation of a nanostructured multiphase microstructure, consisting of NiMn-, FeCo-, and Cr-rich phases embedded in the matrix. By using the concepts of characteristic strain and constraint factor, the strain-dependent plastic flow of nc HEAs was successfully obtained from hardness vs. indenter angle data. Considerable strain softening was revealed in nc HEA samples, which became pronounced as annealing time increased. In the TEM analysis, the volume fractions of NiMn- and FeCo-rich intermetallic phases were reduced by almost one-half as indentation strain increased from 0.08 to 0.22, suggesting that the deformation-assisted dissolution of the precipitates may be the reason for the additional strain softening in annealed nc HEA. The deformation-assisted destabilization of precipitates can be rationalized in consideration of the increase in the interface energy, which in turn can be explained by recourse to the dislocation accumulation and friction at the matrix/particle interfaces.",[],[]
