0,Abstract,"A series of six-component (FeCoNiCrMn)100−                                             x                     Al                        x                      (x                     =0–20at.%) high-entropy alloys (HEAs) was synthesized to investigate the alloying effect of Al on the structure and tensile properties. The microstructures of these alloys were examined using transmission electron microscopy, and crystalline phase evolution was characterized and compared with existing models. It was found that the crystalline structure changed from the initial single face-centered cubic (fcc) structure to a duplex fcc plus body-centered cubic (bcc) structure and then a single bcc structure as the Al concentration was increased. Resulting from the structural changes there were also corresponding variations in tensile properties. In the single fcc region, alloys behaved like a solid solution with relatively low strength but extended ductility. In the mixed structure region, alloys behaved like a composite with a sharp increase in strength but reduced ductility. In the single bcc region, alloys became extremely brittle. In this study, close correlation between the microstructure and mechanical properties was also discussed and presented.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In the past decade, high-entropy alloys (HEAs) have attracted extensive research attention because of their unusual structural properties[1–5]. The traditional design of alloys involves selecting the major component based on a specific property requirement, and further using alloying additions to confer secondary properties without sacrificing the primary property. By contrast, HEAs are multicomponent alloys containing several components (usually ⩾5) in approximately equiatomic proportions. However, it is of particular interest to note that, despite containing a large number of components, HEAs actually exhibit a significant degree of mutual solubility and tend to form simple face-centered cubic (fcc) and/or body-centered cubic (bcc) solid solutions, instead of complex phases and intermetallic compounds[6], which is often attributed to a high mixing (or configuration) entropy.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"Several studies showed that additions of certain elements into HEAs could have strong effects on the crystalline structure, microstructural morphology and the subsequent mechanical properties[7–15]. In the AlxCoCrFeNiTi system[7], for example, the as-cast structure tends to evolve from a mixture of fcc+bcc duplex phases to a single bcc phase with the increase of Al concentration. In another AlCoCrFeNbxNi system[8], it was found that increasing the addition of Nb promoted the transition from hypoeutectic to hypereutectic and such transition had a pronounced effect on the compressive yielding strength and Vickers hardness. However, quantitative and systematic studies on the alloying effects on the microstructural evolution, particularly the transition from one solid solution phase to another, are still rare. In addition, as a result of low ductility and brittleness in many HEAs, most of the reported mechanical properties were either obtained from compression tests or derived from hardness measurements due to a lack of direct information on plastic instability. Comprehensive understanding of the alloying effects on the microstructural and phase evolution, and their impacts on the subsequent tensile properties and strengthening mechanism, are necessary for further development of this new class of materials for structural applications.",[],[]
1,Introduction,"In this study, we selected a FeCoNiCrMn alloy (all elements in equal atomic proportions) as our baseline alloy system. This alloy has a single fcc phase structure[16]and large compressive plasticity. A systematic study of alloying effects of Al on crystal structure, phase evolution, hardness and tensile properties of the (FeCoNiCrMn)100-xAlx(x=0–20at.%) alloys were conducted. The phase formation mechanism and the correlation between property and microstructure were presented.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"Alloy ingots with a nominal composition of (FeCoNiCrMn)100-xAlx(x=0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 20at.%) were synthesized by arc-melting a mixture of pure metals (purity >99wt.%) in a Ti-gettered high-purity argon atmosphere. These ingots were remelted at least four times to ensure chemical homogeneity. Melted alloys were eventually drop-cast into a mold 10mm×10mm×60mm.",[],[]
2,Experimental,"Phase identification of all the specimens was conducted by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using CuKαradiation (MXP21VAHF). The morphology and microstructure of the as-cast specimens were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) using a Zeiss Supra55 operated at 15kV with an energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), and by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with a JEM-2010. For microstructural observation, samples were sequentially ground and polished down to 0.1μm diamond polishing compound, and etched with a solution composed of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid (in a volume ratio of 75:10:5) as well as supersaturated copper sulfate. TEM samples were first mechanically ground to ∼40μm thick and then twin-jet electropolished using a mixed solution of HNO3:CH4O=1:4. Volume fractions of different phases in the alloys were estimated from ten individual areas using the grid method. Tensile samples with a gauge length of 15mm, a width of 5mm and an approximate thickness of 1.3mm were prepared via electric discharging machining. Tensile tests were carried out on a CMT4105 universal electronic tensile testing machine with a strain rate of 1×10−3s−1at room temperature. Hardness measurements were conducted using a Vickers hardness tester (430SVD) with a load of 5N for 15s, and for each specimen, at least 15 indents were measured to obtain an average value.",[],[]
3.1,Results.Structural evolution as a function of the Al concentration,"XRD patterns from the as-cast (FeCoNiCrMn)100-xAlxalloys (denoted as Alxhereafter) are shown in Fig. 1 . Apparently, there is a crystal structure transition from fcc to bcc as the Al content is increased. When the Al concentration is less than 8% (i.e.x<8), only a single fcc crystal structure is observed. However, the (110)bccpeak near the (111)fccpeak begins to appear in the alloy with 9% Al, along with a minor peak from the ordered bcc near 2θ≈30° identified as the (100) plane. In alloys containing a high Al content (i.e.x⩾16), only bcc diffraction peaks are identified, suggesting that either the fcc phase no longer exists or its amount is below the detectable limit of XRD measurements. Detailed evolution of the two characteristic crystalline peaks, i.e. (111)fccand (110)bcc, are demonstrated in Fig. 2 a and b. As indicated, the (111)fccpeak initially shifts towards the low 2θangle, but switches to the high 2θangle in the alloys containing more than 8% Al. The (110)bccpeak shifting is more complicated in alloys having an Al content from 8% to 16%, as a result of the formation of duplex solid solutions. It is worth noting that, in alloy Al8, a weak peak already commences at almost the same 2θdegree as the (110)bccpeak of alloy Al9, suggesting the formation of a low volume fraction of the bcc phase.","['f0005', 'f0010']",[]
3.1,Results.Structural evolution as a function of the Al concentration,"To further investigate phase formation caused by the Al addition, microstructures of the as-cast alloys with different Al contents are presented in Fig. 3 . Al0and Al4alloys are selected to represent alloys with a single fcc phase (see Fig. 3 a and b). Equiaxed fcc grains are observed in these alloys, consistent with the XRD patterns shown in Fig. 1 . Fig. 3 c–j exhibits microstructural morphologies of the Al8, Al9, Al10, Al11, Al12, Al13, Al14and Al16samples, respectively. In Fig. 3 c (i.e. Al8), few dark regions (identified as the bcc phase) are found to be located along grain boundaries; these dark regions correspond to the minor peak mentioned in the XRD analysis ( Fig. 1 ). As the Al content is further increased, the dark region also expanded. In Al10, equiaxed grains are gradually replaced by bright dendrites, and the dark bcc phase is spread in the inter-dendrite region (see Fig. 3 d and e). Chemical compositions of the dendritic and inter-dendritic regions were analyzed using EDS and the results are listed in Table 1 . The dark bcc phase is noted to contain much more Al than the bright fcc dendrites.","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0005', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0005', 'f0015']",['t0005']
3.1,Results.Structural evolution as a function of the Al concentration,"With additional Al, the morphology of the fcc phase further evolves from dendrites to a lamella-like structure known as the Widmanstätten side-plates[17], whilst the bcc phase constitutes the inter-side-plate areas in the Al11and Al12samples ( Fig. 3 f and g). Long side-plates developed from boundaries and grew across grains in Al11, but in Al12alloy these plates are much shorter and thinner. This bcc phase gradually becomes dominant in Al13, Al14and Al16( Fig. 3 h–j), and the minor fcc phase mainly lies in the bcc grain boundaries. A nano-scale, basket-weave-like structure is found in the bcc structure (e.g. Al14and Al16shown in Fig. 3 i and j). Combining with the XRD results, it is speculated that all the bcc phases were initially formed via spinodal decomposition into modulated plate structures of the disordered bcc (A2) phase and the ordered bcc (B2) phase[18,19]. A similar observation has also been reported before in other Al-containing HEA systems, e.g. AlxCoCrCuFeNi and AlxCoCrFeNi[20,21], which also offers a reason for the appearance of two image contrasts in the bcc phase region. Finally, the morphology of the simple bcc alloy Al20is presented in Fig. 3 k in which equiaxial dendrites are clearly revealed with distinctive chemical segregation, mainly Fe and Cr, as indicated in Table 1 .","['f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015', 'f0015']",['t0005']
3.1,Results.Structural evolution as a function of the Al concentration,"In summary, the current high-entropy (FeCoNiCrMn)100−xAlxalloys in the as-cast state can be divided into three categories based on their crystalline structures: single fcc alloys with less than 8% Al (i.e.x<8), duplex fcc–bcc alloys with the Al content between 8% and 16% (i.e. 8%<x<16%) and simple bcc alloys with more than 16% Al (i.e.x>16%). For easy discussion, we herein denote these three categories as regions I, II and III, respectively.",[],[]
3.2,Results.Tensile properties and hardness,"Engineering stress–strain curves for the current HEAs containing different amounts of Al are depicted in Fig. 4 a. The fracture strength, yield strength and tensile ductility as a function of Al are displayed in Fig. 4 b, whilst hardness vs. the Al content is also shown in Fig. 4 c. It is noted that the hardness over tensile strength ratio is ∼3.13±0.39 in the current alloys, similar to that in conventional steels[22], and obeys well the Tabor relationship[23]. In region I, both the fracture and yield strength, as well as hardness, slightly increase with increasing Al concentration. Specifically, the fracture and yield strength of Al0are 496 and 209MPa, respectively, but increase slightly to 529 and 242MPa, respectively, in Al7; the corresponding hardness increases from 176 HV for Al0to 182HV for Al7. Meanwhile, tensile elongation reduces from 61.7% in Al0to 47.2% in Al7, but is still quite high.","['f0020', 'f0020', 'f0020']",[]
3.2,Results.Tensile properties and hardness,"The work hardening coefficientNcan be calculated using the Holloman equation:(1)σ=KεNwhereσis the stress,εis the plastic strain andKis a material constant[24]. TheNvalues are calculated to be 0.56, 0.53, 0.50, 0.47, 0.4, 0.2 and 0.15 in Al0, Al4, Al7, Al8, Al9, Al10and Al11, respectively, which decreases with increasing Al concentration. The descending value with increasing Al content is noted to be consistent with the ductility trend exhibited in Fig. 4 a, according to the classical Considerê criterion for plastic instability, namely,εnecking≈N[25]. In fact, plastic instability or sample necking was observed in the current alloys, especially when they are in a solid-solution state, i.e. Alx(x=0–8).",['f0020'],[]
3.2,Results.Tensile properties and hardness,"For the alloys in region II, in contrast to region I, both tensile and yield strength rise sharply with the Al content, and reach their maximum values of 1174 and 832MPa, respectively, at 11% Al (or in the Al11alloy). However, tensile elongation also rapidly decreases with the increase of Al and reduces to 7.7% in Al11. When the Al concentration exceeds 11%, the as-cast specimens become very brittle and cannot be stretched in tension. In parallel, their Vickers hardness value also sharply increases with the Al level and approaches a value of 538HV in Al14. In region III, alloys with more than 16% Al, the hardness value becomes saturated and remains essentially the same.",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and transition,"In conventional alloys such as steels, the addition of aluminum usually promotes the formation of bcc α-Fe and destabilizes fcc γ-Fe[26]. In a similar manner, aluminum is also a strong bcc stabilizer and the phase transition from fcc to bcc induced by Al addition has also been observed in many HEA systems[7,12,21,27]. However, systematic characterization of the microstructure–property relationship as a result of Al additions has not yet been performed.",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and transition,"Several physical parameters have been proposed to predict structural stability and phase formation in HEAs[28,30–32]. From a thermodynamic point of view, and in particular derived from Hume–Rothery rules, Zhang et al. suggested a criterion for achieving solid-solution phases in HEAs using two parameters, ΔHmix(enthalpy of mixing) andδ(atomic radius difference)[28], as expressed below:(2)δ=∑i=1nci(1-ri/r¯)2(3)ΔHmix=∑i=1,i≠jnΩijcicj=4∑i=1,i≠jnΔHijmixcicjwhereriis the Goldschmidt atomic radius of theith element,ciis the molar ratio andΔHijmixis the enthalpy of mixing between theith andjth elements. The parameterδcharacterizes the atomic size mismatch, which produces the local elastic strain and determines the system topological instability[29], while the parameter ΔHmixreflects the tendency of forming stable intermetallic compounds. Using available data from various HEAs systems, the criteria for forming random solid solutions in HEAs upon rapid solidification were determined to be –15<ΔHmix<5kJmol−1and 1%<δ<5%[29]. On the other hand, criteria for forming a mixture of ordered solid-solution and random solid-solution are −20<ΔHmix<0kJmol−1and 5%<δ<6.6%. To further include the mixing entropy effect, an additional parameterΩwas also proposed to be useful[30]:(4)Ω=TmΔSmix|ΔHmix|whereTmis the average melting temperature and ΔSmixis the entropy of mixing of the alloy system, which are calculated separately as:(5)Tm=∑i=1nci(Tm)i(6)ΔSmix=-R∑i=1n(cilnci)where (Tm)istands for the melting point of theith element andR(= 8.314JK−1mol−1) is the gas constant. It was argued thatΩmust be greater than unity[30]; specifically the effect of entropy of mixing must overshadow the enthalpy of mixing in order to favor formation of high-entropy phases. From available data, it was concluded that the criteria for forming single solid solutions areΩ⩾1.1 andδ<6.6%[30].",[],[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and transition,"For the current Al-containing alloys, we plot the ΔHmix–δandΩ–δgraphs in Fig. 5 a and b, respectively. It is evident in Fig. 5 a that the ΔHmix–δcriterion might be able to predict the coexistence of ordered and disordered solid solutions, but ineffectively describes the structure transition from the single random fcc solid solution to the mixture of fcc and bcc, and to the single bcc region. For theΩ–δcriterion, the current alloys fall into the zone where the predicted solid-solution region and solid-solution+intermetallics region overlap. Therefore, similar to the ΔHmix–δrelation, thisΩ–δcriterion reasonably predicts the formation of the solid solutions, but seems ineffectively to separate the exact crystal structure of these random solid solutions, i.e. fcc, bcc or fcc+bcc.","['f0025', 'f0025']",[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and transition,"From an electronic structure point of view, Guo and Liu[31]and Gou et al.[32]proposed another parameter, valence electron concentration (VEC), which is essentially thee/aratio, to predict the phase stability of HEAs:(7)VEC=∑i=1nci(VEC)iwhereciis the atomic percentage and (VEC)iis the VEC for theith element, respectively. In Guo’s study, fcc solid-solution phases were found to be stable at a VEC value larger than 8, while bcc solid-solution phases were formed at a VEC value lower than 6.87. The VEC value of the current HEA alloys is calculated and its variation with the Al content is shown in Fig. 6 . It is noted that with the increase of Al, the VEC is linearly decreased, confirming that the Al addition gradually promotes covalency. Although alloys with a mixed fcc and bcc structure fall within the predicted region, the VEC criterion obviously offers a wider boundary condition for forming the single fcc and bcc solid solution phases, as compared with the experimental data. This observation suggests that in addition to atomic bonding, other factors also played an important role in phase formation resulting from the Al additions. Moreover, a more sophistical criterion that can effectively predict the phase formation in the current HEA system and describe the alloying effect of Al is needed.",['f0030'],[]
4.1,Discussion.Phase formation and transition,"It is pointed out that aluminum atom has a larger radius than the other transition metals in the system. Thus, the solutioning of Al into FeCoNiCrMn is expected to distort the lattice. From a viewpoint of strain energy, it would cause a change of crystal structure. Fig. 7 shows the lattice constant of the FeCoNiCrMn alloys containing different amounts of Al. Evidently, as Al is initially added in the fcc HEA, the lattice constant is increased with the increase of Al, and this causes an apparent lattice straining effect[3,29]. In other words, large lattice distortion energy is produced, which destabilizes the fcc structure. Since bcc structure generally has a lower atomic packing density (68%) than fcc and hexagonal close packed structures (both 74%), it can more readily accommodate larger solute atoms like Al. Therefore, excessive addition of Al is anticipated to induce the transition from a close-packed fcc to a loose-packed bcc structure so that lattice distortion energy is relaxed[33]. This simple point of view works only if no intermetallic compound is formed.",['f0035'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Relationship between the structure and mechanical properties,"According to Figs. 3  and 4, the mechanical properties of the current HEAs are strongly dependent upon their microstructures. For the alloys in the single fcc solid solution phase region (i.e. region I), the lattice constant almost linearly increases with the increase of Al (see Fig. 7 ), which can be understood via Vegard’s law[34]. The hardness, yield and tensile strength all slightly increase as the Al concentration is increased ( Fig. 4 ), suggesting a solution strengthening effect caused by the enlarged lattice distortion; atomic radius of Al (rAl=0.143nm) is ∼13% larger than that of Fe (rFe=0.126nm). Here, we use the change of hardness ΔH[35]to measure the potency of solution strengthening via a standard model for substitutional solid solution strengthening based on elastic dislocation–solute interactions[36,37]:(8)ΔH=33/2∗G∗εs3/2∗c1/2700whereGis the shear modulus of FeCoNiCrMn, estimated to be 74GPa[38],cis the molar ratio of Al and the 33/2is a conversion factor from shear stress to hardness. The interaction parameterεsis expressed as:(9)εs=εG1+0.5εG-3∗εawhich combines the effects of elastic and atomic size mismatch, i.e.εGandεa, and they are defined respectively as:(10)εG=1G∂G∂c(11)εa=1a∂a∂cwhereais the lattice constant of FeCoNiCrMn.","['f0035', 'f0020', 'f0015', 'f0020']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Relationship between the structure and mechanical properties,"Considering that the effect ofεGis relatively negligible in comparison withεa,εacan be obtained from Fig. 7 , and thus the value ofεsis readily calculated. For example, for alloy Al7, with the largest lattice constant in region I, the strength increment caused by the solution strengthening is ∼28MPa. Compared with the experimental hardness increment between Al0and Al7(∼6HV or 58.8MPa), this increment is smaller but within the order of magnitude.",['f0035'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Relationship between the structure and mechanical properties,"For the alloys in region II (i.e. containing 8–16% Al), the volume fraction of the bcc phases in the alloys is estimated and the results are shown in Fig. 8 a. It is known that bcc phases are typically more brittle but stronger than fcc phases due to the difference in the number of their available slip systems. The fact that both the bcc volume fraction and the strength (or hardness) are approximately scaled with the Al concentration readily suggests that alloys in this region may behave like the traditional composites. Therefore, to the first approximation, the strength of the alloys can be described by the simple rule-of-mixture[39], i.e.(12)σ=σfcc∗Vfcc+σbcc∗Vbccwhereσfcc∗andσbcc∗are the tensile strength of the fcc and bcc phases,VfccandVbccstand for the volume fraction of the two phases, respectively, andVfcc+Vbcc=1. Eq.(12)can then be converted to(13)σ=σfcc∗+(σbcc∗-σfcc∗)Vbcc",['f0040'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Relationship between the structure and mechanical properties,"Consequently, strength data measured from Al8to Al11, i.e. alloys in region II, are plotted as a function ofVbccin Fig. 8 b. A good linear relationship is observed, indicating that the composite model offers reasonable interpretation for the strength increment when the Al content is within 8–11%. It is especially noted that Al11alloy having a composite structure exhibits the highest attainable fracture strength of 1174MPa and yield strength of 832MPa with a tensile ductility of 7.7%. However, alloys with more than 11% Al are too brittle to be deformed under tensile loading.",['f0040'],[]
4.2,Discussion.Relationship between the structure and mechanical properties,"To correlate microstructure with property in the current HEA system, TEM examinations of Al11, Al13and Al16samples have been conducted and the results are shown in Fig. 9 . Both the TEM image and the selected-area electron diffraction pattern clearly confirm that Al11consists of a mixture of fcc and bcc phases. Based on the dark field image in Fig. 9 b, it is revealed that the cubic-shaped particles are ordered B2 while the inter-precipitate area is disordered A2. As a matter of fact, this particular alloy is a metallic composite consisting of 74.6% fcc and 25.4% bcc phases. Such composite structure is responsible for the observed high tensile strength and good ductility. In alloy Al13( Fig. 9 c and d), the cubic-shaped precipitates become slightly smaller but more close-packed as compared to that in the Al11alloy. In addition, the bcc volume fraction is sharply increased to over 80%. The significant increment in the ordered B2 indicates that the Al addition promotes covalency and the ordering degree in this alloy is enhanced. As the Al content is further increased, TEM images in Fig. 9 e and f show that alloy Al16contains spherical A2 particles with a size of 100nm embedded in the B2 matrix. A limited fcc phase can be found only on the boundaries of the bcc grains. These observations suggest that the ordering degree is further developed, leading to an even more brittle material.","['f0045', 'f0045', 'f0045', 'f0045']",[]
4.2,Discussion.Relationship between the structure and mechanical properties,"For the alloys in region III (e.g. Al20), their microstructural features are similar to those in the Al16alloy, as demonstrated by TEM images shown in Fig. 9 g and h. The fcc particles disappear completely, and these alloys actually show a similar hardness value as that of alloy Al16(see Fig. 4 b), although their lattice constants increase with the Al concentration ( Fig. 9 ).","['f0045', 'f0020', 'f0045']",[]
5,Conclusions,"In this study, the microstructure and tensile properties of a series of (FeCoNiCrMn)100−xAlx(x=0–20at.%) high-entropy alloys were characterized and evaluated. Alloying effects of Al on the phase formation, strength and ductility of these alloys were discussed. Based on obtained results and analyses, tentative conclusions can be drawn as follows.1.From microstructural observations, the Al-containing alloys can be divided into three regions: the single fcc region with an Al concentration below 8% (region I), the duplex phases of the fcc+bcc region with the Al content between 8% and 16% (region II) and the bcc solid solution region with more than 16% Al (region III).2.In region I (Al<8%), alloys behave like a solid solution alloy with the added Al atom as the primary strengthener. Alloys have a tensile strength of ∼500MPa, yield strength of ∼220MPa and elongation between 61.7% and 47.2%.3.In region II (8%<Al<16%), bcc phases begin to appear and both the fracture and yield strength are drastically increased, but the ductility is reduced sharply. Alloys in this region behave like a composite. Particularly, Al11has a composite structure containing 25.4% bcc and exhibits the highest attainable tensile strength of 1174MPa with 7.7% ductility. However, alloys with more than 11% Al have poor ductility.4.In region III (Al>16%), alloys consist of disordered A2 precipitates embedded in an ordered B2 matrix. Microstructural characterization suggests that the two bcc phases were formed via spinodal decomposition. Alloys in this region are extremely brittle.5.The observed crystalline phases in the current FeCoNiCrMn induced by the Al addition cannot be fully predicted using the existing criteria, suggesting that additional work is necessary for the understanding of phase transition in HEAs.",[],[]
