fig1,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.09.035/figures/gr1.jpg,Fig. 1,"a) Microstructure of the coarse-grained, as-received state. In the inset the average chemical composition determined by an EDX line scan can be seen. b) Evolution of hardness as a function of shear strain during HPT processing. For γ larger than 40 a saturation in hardness is achieved. c)-e) BSE images of the microstructure development at relatively low shear strains. c) At γ close to 1 the typical formation of dislocation substructures as well as the onset of a localization of deformation (see arrows) can be observed. d) and e) show an increase in the number of deformation bands with an increase in shear strain."
fig2,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.09.035/figures/gr2.jpg,Fig. 2,"a) STEM image of the steady-state microstructure of the TiZrNbHfTa alloy after being subjected to shear strains larger than 40. The inset is a corresponding electron diffraction pattern, showing that the material retains its single-phase bcc character during HPT deformation. b) This was also confirmed via synchrotron XRD measurements."
fig3,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.09.035/figures/gr3.jpg,Fig. 3,a) Isochronal annealing treatments performed for 1 h lead to an increase in hardness up to annealing temperatures of 600 °C. b) Isothermal heat treatments at 500 °C reveal that a significant portion of the hardening occurs within very short times spans of just 5 min.
fig4,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.09.035/figures/gr4.jpg,Fig. 4,"a) Bright field image of a specimen annealed at 500 °C for 1 h and b) a HAADF image of the same position, showing a two-phase microstructure. c) and d) for longer annealing times of 100 h grain coarsening occurs, but no additional phases compared to the 1 h state can be detected. e) and f) after an annealing treatment at 800 °C for 1 h the microstructure is still ultra-fine grained and shows a phase decomposition of the bcc high entropy phase. The insets in a), c) and e) show corresponding electron diffraction patterns."
fig5,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.09.035/figures/gr5.jpg,Fig. 5,"EDX line-scan data (a), c) and e)) of the annealed specimens, show the changes in the chemical composition occurring during the phase decomposition, while the HAADF images show the location, where the scans were performed (b), d) and f)). a) Sample annealed at 500 °C for 1 h. The hcp phase (darker regions in the HAADF image b)) is clearly enriched in Zr and Hf, while differences in chemistry in the bcc phase (Nb-Ta) are not that pronounced yet. c) For longer annealing times (t = 100 h) at 500 °C the changes get more pronounced and the bcc phase (lighter regions) is much richer in Nb and Ta. e) At 800 °C for 1 h phases enriched in Nb-Ta and Zr-Hf occur as well."
fig6,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.09.035/figures/gr6.jpg,Fig. 6,"BSE images of samples annealed for 1 h at a) 900 °C, b) 1000 °C and c) 1100 °C. Samples at 900 °C show an inhomogeneous microstructure, where some grains have grown, while others still remain fine-grained with second-phase precipitation occurring at the grain boundaries. Samples at higher temperatures, see b) and c), have recrystallized and the only phase occurring is the original bcc high-entropy phase."
fig7,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.09.035/figures/gr7.jpg,Fig. 7,a) Synchrotron XRD data of the HPT deformed and subsequently annealed material. For 500 °C a phase decomposition of the single-phase HEA into a bcc and hcp phase can be detected. At 800 °C two bcc and one hcp phase are present. b) Detailed view of a) over a reduced 2Θ range. The additional information on the chemistry was obtained by TEM investigations.
fig8,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.09.035/figures/gr8.jpg,Fig. 8,"Calphad simulations of the TiZrNbHfTa alloy with the TCHEA1 database: a) evolution with temperature of the mole fraction of the stable phases; b) zoom of the 200–1200 °C range of a); Evolution of the composition for the different phases (left axis) for BCC_B2#2 (c), BCC_B2#1 (d) and HCP_A3#1 (e). The mole fraction is given on the right axis. All the solid phases (BCC_B2#1, B2#2, HCP_A3#1, A3#2) are disordered."
fig9,articles_test/10.1016.j.actamat.2017.09.035/figures/gr9.jpg,Fig. 9,"a) Tensile stress-strain curves of the TiZrNbHfTa alloy in different microstructural states. b)-e) secondary electron images of fractured tensile samples. b) shows the ductile fractures surfaces of the as-received material. c), after HPT processing the specimens still shows a dimple fracture. After annealing the samples at 500 °C the fracture mode changes to an intercrystalline fracture, d). e) increasing the annealing temperatures further leads to a recovery of ductility."
